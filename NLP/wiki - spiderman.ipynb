He first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books . He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics , as well as in a number of movies, television shows, and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe . In the stories, Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker , an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues, and accompanied him with many supporting characters , such as J. Jonah Jameson , Harry Osborn , Max Modell , romantic interests  Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson , and foes such as Doctor Octopus , the Green Goblin and Venom . His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his \"spider-sense.\" He then builds wrist-mounted \"web-shooter\" devices that shoot artificial spider-webbing of his own design. When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist . The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man\\'s secret identity and with whose \"self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness\" young readers could relate. [9] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin , Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman ; he thus had to learn for himself that \" with great power there must also come great responsibility \"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben Parker. Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series , the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man . Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2010s, he joins the Avengers . Spider-Man\\'s nemesis Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die. [10] Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man , including Spider-Man 2099 , which features the adventures of Miguel O\\'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man , which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe ; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man , which depicts the teenager Miles Morales , who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker\\'s supposed death. Miles is later brought into mainstream continuity, where he sometimes works alongside Peter. Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. [11] He has appeared in countless forms of media , including several animated and live action  television series , syndicated newspaper comic strips , and in a series of films . The character was first portrayed in live action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories , a The Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977. [12] In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire , Andrew Garfield , [13] and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland . He was voiced by Chris Pine and Jake Johnson in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse . Reeve Carney starred originally as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical  Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark . [14] Spider-Man has been well received as a superhero and comic book character, and he is often ranked as one of the most popular and iconic comic book characters of all time and one of the most popular characters in all fiction.

Stan Lee stated that it was the name of this character that inspired him to create a character that would become Spider-Man. [15]  In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four , Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. [16] : 1 In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence, [15] : 130 and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true. [note 1] Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with \"boy\", Lee says he chose \"Spider-Man\" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name \"Spider-Boy\" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes. [17] He also decided to insert a hyphen in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero with a red and blue costume which starts with an \"S\" and ends with \"man\" [18] (although artist Steve Ditko intended the character to have an orange and purple costume). [19] At that time Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character\\'s approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman\\'s objections. [note 2] Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for that single issue, #15 ( cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962). [20] In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man. [17] While this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that \"The Spiderman [ sic ] ... will appear every month in Amazing .\" [20] [21]  Regardless, Lee received Goodman\\'s approval for the name Spider-Man and the \"ordinary teen\" concept and approached artist Jack Kirby . As comics historian  Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby \"immediately sat down for a story conference\", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. [22] Steve Ditko would be the inker. [note 3] When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, \"I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn\\'t the character I wanted; it was too heroic\". [22] : 12 Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:  .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn\\'t have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn\\'t sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character\\'s face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character.... [23]  Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko\\'s cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked. [20] As Lee explained in 2010, \"I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack\\'s covers.\" [24]  In an early recollection of the character\\'s creation, Ditko described his and Lee\\'s contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): \"Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal.\" [25] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton , an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was \"almost nil\", he and Ditko had \"worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands.\" [22] : 14 Ditko claimed in a rare interview with Jonathan Ross that the costume was initially envisioned with an orange and purple color scheme rather than the more famous red and blue. [26]    Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) first introduced the character. It was a gateway to commercial success for the superhero and inspired the launch of The Amazing Spider-Man comic book. Cover art by penciller Jack Kirby and inker Steve Ditko  Kirby disputed Lee\\'s version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character\\'s creation. According to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and Joe Simon , who in the 1950s had developed a character called the Silver Spider for the Crestwood Publications comic Black Magic , who was subsequently not used. [note 4] Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby\\'s account, asserting that Black Magic was not a factor, and that he (Simon) devised the name \"Spider-Man\" (later changed to \"The Silver Spider\"), while Kirby outlined the character\\'s story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby\\'s character conception became the basis for Simon\\'s Archie Comics superhero the Fly . [27] Artist Steve Ditko stated that Lee liked the name Hawkman from DC Comics , and that \"Spider-Man\" was an outgrowth of that interest. [23]  Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results—in Simon\\'s description, \" Captain America with cobwebs\". [note 5] Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee\\'s reasoning that Kirby\\'s character was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for Amazing Fantasy #15 and the first issue of The Amazing Spider-Man . Evanier also disputes Kirby\\'s given reason that he was \"too busy\" to draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties since Kirby was, said Evanier, \"always busy\". [28] : 127 Neither Lee\\'s nor Kirby\\'s explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man, as drawn and envisioned by Kirby, was too similar to the Fly. [28] : 127  Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that \"Stan called Jack about the Fly\", adding that \"[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan\\'s synopsis.\" It was at this point that the nature of the strip changed. \"Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained.\" Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as \"the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series\". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko stated, \"I still don\\'t know whose idea was Spider-Man\". [29] Ditko did, however, view the published version of Spider-Man as a separate creation to the one he saw in the five pencilled pages that Kirby had completed. To support this Ditko used the analogy of the Kirby/Marvel Thor, which was based on a name/idea of a character in Norse mythology: \"If Marvel’s Thor is a valid created work by Jack, his creation, then why isn’t Spider-Man by Stan and me valid created work, our creation?\" [30]  Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who \"got Spider-Man to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did\". [31] Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, has acknowledged Ditko\\'s role, stating, \"If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [it]\". [32] He has further commented that Ditko\\'s costume design was key to the character\\'s success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man\\'s body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character. [17]   Commercial success [ edit ]  A few months after Spider-Man\\'s introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel\\'s highest-selling comics. [33] : 97 A solo ongoing series followed, beginning with The Amazing Spider-Man #1 ( cover-dated March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel\\'s top-selling series [9] : 211 with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon; a 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was \"beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us.\" [9] : 223 Following Ditko\\'s departure after issue #38 (July 1966), John Romita Sr. replaced him as penciller and would draw the series for the next several years. In 1968, Romita would also draw the character\\'s extra-length stories in the comics magazine The Spectacular Spider-Man , a proto- graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers. It only lasted for two issues, but it represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series\\' summer Annual s that began in 1964. [34]  An early 1970s Spider-Man story ultimately led to the revision of the Comics Code . Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of illegal drugs , even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration\\'s Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel\\'s top-selling titles. [9] : 239 Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker\\'s friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry\\'s father), Spider-Man defeats him by revealing Harry\\'s drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority\\'s approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry\\'s self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised. [9] : 239  In 1972, a second monthly ongoing series starring Spider-Man began: Marvel Team-Up , in which Spider-Man was paired with other superheroes and supervillains. [35] From that point on, there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man series at any time. In 1976, his second solo series, Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man began running parallel to the main series. [36] A third series featuring Spider-Man, Web of Spider-Man , launched in 1985 to replace Marvel Team-Up . [37] The launch of a fourth monthly title in 1990, the \"adjectiveless\" Spider-Man (with the storyline \" Torment \"), written and drawn by popular artist Todd McFarlane , debuted with several different covers , all with the same interior content. The various versions combined sold over 3 million copies, an industry record at the time. Several miniseries , one-shot issues, and loosely related comics have also been published, and Spider-Man makes frequent cameos and guest appearances in other comic book series. [36] [38] In 1996, The Sensational Spider-Man was created to replace Web of Spider-Man . [39]  In 1998 writer-artist John Byrne revamped the origin of Spider-Man in the 13-issue limited series Spider-Man: Chapter One (Dec. 1998 – Oct. 1999), similar to Byrne\\'s adding details and some revisions to Superman\\'s origin in DC Comics \\' The Man of Steel . [40] At the same time, the original The Amazing Spider-Man was ended with issue #441 (Nov. 1998), and The Amazing Spider-Man was restarted with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999). [41] In 2003, Marvel reintroduced the original numbering for The Amazing Spider-Man and what would have been vol. 2, #59 became issue #500 (Dec. 2003). [41]  When the primary series The Amazing Spider-Man reached issue #545 (Dec. 2007), Marvel dropped its spin-off ongoing series and instead began publishing The Amazing Spider-Man three times monthly, beginning with #546–548 (all January 2008). [42] The three times-monthly scheduling of The Amazing Spider-Man lasted until November 2010, when the comic book was increased from 22 pages to 30 pages each issue and published only twice a month, beginning with #648–649 (both November 2010). [43] [44] The following year, Marvel launched Avenging Spider-Man as the first spin-off ongoing series in addition to the still-twice monthly The Amazing Spider-Man since the previous ones were canceled at the end of 2007. [42] The Amazing series temporarily ended with issue #700 in December 2012, and was replaced by The Superior Spider-Man , which had Doctor Octopus serve as the new Spider-Man, his mind having taken over Peter Parker\\'s body. Superior was an enormous commercial success for Marvel, [45] and ran for 31 issues before the real Peter Parker returned in a newly relaunched The Amazing Spider-Man #1 in April 2014. [46]  Following the 2015 Secret Wars crossover event, a number of Spider-Man-related titles were either relaunched or created as part of the \" All-New, All-Different Marvel \" event. Among them, The Amazing Spider-Man was relaunched as well and primarily focuses on Peter Parker continuing to run Parker Industries, and becoming a successful businessman who is operating worldwide. [47]   Fictional character biography [ edit ]  Early years [ edit ]  In Forest Hills , Queens , New York City, [48]  Midtown High School student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May . As depicted in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962), he is bitten by a radioactive  spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit and \"acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid \". [49] Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as \"Spider-Man\", becomes a novelty television star. However, \"He blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief , [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben.\" Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story\\'s next-to-last caption, \"With great power there must also come—great responsibility!\" [50]  Despite his superpowers, Parker struggles to help his widowed aunt pay the rent, is taunted by his peers—particularly football star Flash Thompson —and, as Spider-Man, engenders the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson . [51] [52] As he battles his enemies for the first time, [53] Parker finds juggling his personal life and costumed adventures difficult. In time, Peter graduates from high school, [54] and enrolls at Empire State University (a fictional institution evoking the real-life Columbia University and New York University ), [55] where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn , and girlfriend Gwen Stacy , [56] and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson . [53] [57] [58] As Peter deals with Harry\\'s drug problems, and Harry\\'s father is revealed to be Spider-Man\\'s nemesis the Green Goblin , Peter even attempts to give up his costumed identity for a while. [59] [60] Gwen Stacy\\'s father, New York City Police detective captain George Stacy is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (issue #90, November 1970). [61]   1970s [ edit ]  This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .  ( August 2019 )  In issue #121 (June 1973), [53] the Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge (as depicted in the art) or the George Washington Bridge (as given in the text). [62] [63] She dies during Spider-Man\\'s rescue attempt; a note on the letters page of issue #125 states: \"It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey\\'s webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her.\" [64] The following issue, the Goblin appears to kill himself accidentally in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man. [65]  Working through his grief, Parker eventually develops tentative feelings toward Watson, and the two \"become confidants rather than lovers\". [66] A romantic relationship eventually develops, with Parker proposing to her in issue #182 (July 1978), and being turned down an issue later. [67] Parker went on to graduate from college in issue #185, [53] and becomes involved with the shy Debra Whitman and the extroverted, flirtatious costumed thief Felicia Hardy, a.k.a. the Black Cat , [68] whom he meets in issue #194 (July 1979). [53]    The Amazing Spider-Man #252 (May 1984): The black costume debut that brought controversy to many fans. The suit was later revealed as an alien symbiote and was used in the creation of the villain Venom , cover art by Ron Frenz and Klaus Janson  1980s [ edit ]  From 1984 to 1988, Spider-Man wore a black costume with a white spider design on his chest. The new costume originated in the Secret Wars  miniseries , on an alien planet where Spider-Man participates in a battle between Earth\\'s major superheroes and supervillains. [69] He continues wearing the costume when he returns, starting in The Amazing Spider-Man #252. The change to a longstanding character\\'s design met with controversy, \"with many hardcore comics fans decrying it as tantamount to sacrilege. Spider-Man\\'s traditional red and blue costume was iconic, they argued, on par with those of his D.C. rivals Superman and Batman .\" [70] The creators then revealed the costume was an alien symbiote which Spider-Man is able to reject after a difficult struggle, [71] though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge. [53] Parker proposes to Watson in The Amazing Spider-Man #290 (July 1987), and she accepts two issues later, with the wedding taking place in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21 (1987)—promoted with a real-life mock wedding using actors at Shea Stadium , with Stan Lee officiating, on June 5, 1987. [72]  David Michelinie , who scripted based on a plot by editor-in-chief Jim Shooter , said in 2007, \"I didn\\'t think they actually should [have gotten] married. ... I had actually planned another version, one that wasn\\'t used.\" [72] Parker published a book of Spider-Man photographs called Webs . [73] and returned to his Empire State University graduate studies in biochemistry in #310 (Dec. 1988). [53]   1990s [ edit ]  In the controversial [74] 1990s storyline the \" Clone Saga \", a clone of Parker, created in 1970s comics by insane scientist Miles Warren , a.k.a. the Jackal, returns to New York City upon hearing of Aunt May \\'s health worsening. The clone had lived incognito as \" Ben Reilly \", but now assumes the superhero guise the Scarlet Spider and allies with Parker. To the surprise of both, new tests indicate \"Reilly\" is the original and \"Parker\" the clone. [75] Complicating matters, Watson announces in The Spectacular Spider-Man #220 (Jan. 1995) that she is pregnant with Parker\\'s baby. [53] Later, however, a resurrected Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) has Watson poisoned, causing premature labor and the death of her and Parker\\'s unborn daughter. [76] The Green Goblin had switched the results of the clone test in an attempt to destroy Parker\\'s life by making him believe himself to be the clone. Reilly is killed while saving Parker, in Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75 (Dec. 1996), and his body immediately crumbles into dust, confirming Reilly was the clone. [76]  In issue #97 (Nov. 1998) of the second series titled Peter Parker: Spider-Man , [77] Parker learns his Aunt May was kidnapped by Norman Osborn and her apparent death in The Amazing Spider-Man #400 (April 1995) had been a hoax. [78] [79] Shortly afterward, in The Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 2) #13 (#454, Jan. 2000), Watson is apparently killed in an airplane explosion. [80] She turns up alive and well in (vol. 2) #28 (#469, April 2001), [80] but she and Peter become separated in the following issue. [81]   2000s [ edit ]  Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski began writing The Amazing Spider-Man , illustrated by John Romita Jr. , beginning with (vol. 2) #30 (#471, June 2001). Two issues later, Parker, now employed as a teacher at his old high school, meets the enigmatic Ezekiel , who possesses similar spider powers and suggests that Parker having gained such abilities might not have been a fluke—that Parker has a connection to a totemic spider spirit. In (vol. 2) #37 (#478, Jan. 2002), May discovers her nephew Parker is Spider-Man, leading to a new openness in their relationship. [79] Parker and Watson reconcile in (vol. 2) #50 (#491, April 2003), [79] and in #512 (Nov. 2004)—the original issue numbering having returned with #500—Parker learns his late girlfriend Gwen Stacy had had two children with Norman Osborn . [82]  He joins the superhero team the New Avengers in New Avengers #1–2. After their respective homes are destroyed by a deranged, superpowered former high-school classmate, Parker, Watson, and May move into Stark Tower , and Parker begins working as Tony Stark \\'s assistant while again freelancing for The Daily Bugle and continuing his teaching. In the 12-part 2005 story arc \" The Other \", Parker undergoes a transformation that evolves his powers . In the comic Civil War #2 (June 2006), part of the company-wide crossover arc of that title, the U.S. government\\'s Superhuman Registration Act leads Spider-Man to reveal his true identity publicly. A growing unease about the Registration Act prompts him to escape with May and Watson and join the anti-registration underground. In issue #537 (Dec. 2006), May is critically wounded by a sniper hired by Wilson Fisk and enters into a coma. Parker, desperate to save her, exhausts all possibilities and makes a pact with the demon-lord Mephisto , who saves May\\'s life in exchange for Parker and Watson agreeing to have their marriage and all memory of it disappear. In this changed reality, Spider-Man\\'s identity is secret once again, and in #545 (Jan. 2008), Watson returns and is cold toward him. That controversial [83] storyline, \"One More Day\", rolled back much of the fictional continuity at the behest of editor-in-chief Joe Quesada , who said, \"Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of Spider-Man\". [83] It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer Straczynski, who \"told Joe that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the [story] arc\", but was talked out of doing so. [84] At issue with Straczynski\\'s climax to the arc, Quesada said, was  ...that we didn\\'t receive the story and methodology to the resolution that we were all expecting. What made that very problematic is that we had four writers and artists well underway on [the sequel arc] \"Brand New Day\" that were expecting and needed \"One More Day\" to end in the way that we had all agreed it would. ... The fact that we had to ask for the story to move back to its original intent understandably made Joe upset and caused some major delays and page increases in the series. Also, the science that Joe was going to apply to the retcon of the marriage would have made over 30 years of Spider-Man books worthless, because they never would have had happened. ...[I]t would have reset way too many things outside of the Spider-Man titles. We just couldn\\'t go there.... [84]  In this new continuity, designed to have very limited repercussions throughout the remainder of the Marvel Universe , Parker returns to work at the Daily Bugle , which has been renamed The DB under a new publisher. [85] He soon switches to the alternative press paper The Front Line . [86]  J. Jonah Jameson becomes the Mayor of New York City in issue #591 (June 2008). [82] Jameson\\'s estranged father, J. Jonah Jameson, Sr., marries May in issue #600 (Sept. 2009). [82] [87]  During the \" Secret Invasion \" by shape-shifting extra-terrestrials, the Skrulls , Norman Osborn shoots and kills the Skrull queen Veranke . [88] He leverages this widely publicized success, positioning himself as the new director of the S.H.I.E.L.D.-like paramilitary force H.A.M.M.E.R. to advance his agenda, [88] while using his public image to start his own Dark Avengers . Norman himself leads the Dark Avengers as the Iron Patriot, a suit of armor fashioned by himself after Iron Man\\'s armor with Captain America\\'s colors. [89]  Harry is approached by Norman with the offer of a job within the Dark Avengers. It is later revealed that it is a ruse to coerce Harry into taking the American Son armor, whom Norman had planned to kill, in order to increase public sympathy. When Harry has the option of killing Norman, Spider-Man says to decapitate him, since Norman\\'s healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man also cautions Harry that killing Norman will cause Harry to \"become the son Norman always wanted\". Harry instead backs down, and turns away from his father forever.

( January 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )  Siege [ edit ]  Main article: Siege (comics)  At Loki \\'s suggestion,Norman Osborn creates a rationale to invade Asgard , claiming the world (which was, at the time, positioned at the outskirts of Broxton, Oklahoma ) poses a national security threat. During a pitched battle with several superheroes, Norman Osborn fights with the recently-resurrected Steve Rogers, however, Iron Man removes Osborn\\'s Iron Patriot armor remotely, revealing Osborn used green facepaint to create a goblin-like look. Osborn screams that the Avengers do not know what they have done, only for Spider-Man to knock him down. [91] He ends up incarcerated in the Raft penitentiary, blaming his Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world. [92]   \"Big Time\" [ edit ]  Main article: Spider-Man: Big Time  After Osborn\\'s fall and the Registration Act\\'s abolition following the Siege of Asgard, MJ invited Peter over so the two of them could gain closure over the marriage that did not happen and the breakup. [93] Later, a massive war ensued between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man to get Lily Hollister\\'s and Norman Osborn\\'s son, in which Spider-Man found that the child was actually Harry\\'s, who later leaves town to raise him. Peter then finally starts a relationship with police officer Carlie Cooper.\\nSpider-Man\\'s heroic career rose up again, he joined the reassembled Avengers and also stayed with the New Avengers, who were outlaws no more. He learned that Michele was moving and he could not maintain his apartment anymore. However, Peter found a dream job, thanks to Jameson\\'s wife Marla Madison, as a compensation for Jameson firing him, as a scientist at Horizon Labs where he had access to much more technology and resources while also giving him freedom to come and go as he liked so long as he delivered good results. Spider-Man assisted the Avengers in defeating Doctor Octopus\\' army of Macro-Octobots. He then faced a new Hobgoblin and the Kingpin, but days later, he lamentably lost Marla in a fight between Alistair Alphonso Smythe\\'s Spider-Slayers. [94]   \"Spider-Island\" [ edit ]  Main article: Spider-Island  After helping Anti-Venom (Eddie Brock) to reveal Mr. Negative\\'s identity [95] (as well as learning that Aunt May was moving to Boston with Jay) Spider-Man found himself with a new problem: the Jackal returned and gave the majority of New Yorkers spider-powers. [96] The Queen was revealed as the true mastermind: she wanted to turn the whole human race into spiders. Mr. Fantastic created a cure using the Anti-Venom Symbiote, and after battling Peter (under the Jackal\\'s influence), Peter\\'s clone Kaine was accidentally cured from his mutations, turning him into a perfect clone.\\nWhile he and the Avengers battled the Spider-Queen in Central Park, Kaine killed her and Peter managed to get the cure to every citizen via Doctor Octopus\\'s (mentally controlled) Octobots. He met with Jay and May while they were leaving for Boston. Peter then ran into Kaine, who told Peter that he was leaving New York and with Peter\\'s stealth suit, since Madame Web had told Kaine he may need it. Also, because of revealing he had spider-powers during the Spider-Island event, Peter\\'s psychic blind spot was weakened, letting Carlie know he was Spider-Man, which caused her to break up with him. Before giving a last cure sample to MJ, who briefly attempted to keep some spider-powers, Spider-Man met with Madame Web on the roof of Horizon Labs. She told him that he could de-power himself with the cure sample and someone else will step in to take his place. Peter refuses, saying that throwing his gift away would be the most irresponsible thing he has ever done. Madame Web warns that he is to suffer a loss. He then cures MJ and they look at the Empire State Building, lit in red and blue in his honor.  The Superior Spider-Man [ edit ]  Main article: The Superior Spider-Man  In the middle of a fight against the Hobgoblin, while his spider-sense was overloaded, Spider-Man was unsuspectedly pinched by one of Doctor Octopus\\' Octobots programmed to swap consciousness between the two, causing Peter to become trapped in the dying body of his foe while Doctor Octopus claimed Peter\\'s life for himself. In an attempt to take back his life with the little time he had left, Peter broke out of Octopus\\'s cell in the Raft [97] leading to a final confrontation between the two in the Avengers Tower. Though Peter failed to reverse the change, he managed to establish a weak link with Otto\\'s mind using an Octobot. In his final moments, Peter forced Otto Octavius to relive all of his memories. Having experienced in a flash all of Peter\\'s trials and tribulations, Otto learned his lesson of power and responsibility and swore to carry on with Peter\\'s life with dignity as a superior Spider-Man. [98]  Since Peter was mentally connected to Otto when his body perished, a portion of himself survived in his original body, but in the form of a subconsciousness, thus not able to control the actions of his body entirely. [99] Even though Otto attempted to rid of this remnant of Peter, [100] he decided to seek its help sometime later after being overwhelmed by the returned Green Goblin and his Goblin Nation. Realizing that he failed in his role as the \"superior\" Spider-Man, having pushed his allies aside and lost his resources in the process, Otto willingly allowed Peter to reclaim his body in order to defeat Osborn once and for all and save Anna Maria Marconi, Otto\\'s love. [101] In the aftermath of Otto\\'s possession of his body, Peter began to amend the relationships damaged by Otto\\'s arrogance and negligence, both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He additionally took up the reins of Parker Industries, a small company founded by Otto after leaving Horizon Labs. [102]   \"All-New Marvel NOW\" [ edit ]  While adjusting to his new status quo, especially his position as the CEO of his very own company, [103] Peter learned of the existence of Cindy Moon, a second person to have been bit by the same radioactive spider which granted Peter his powers. Spider-Man tracked her down and freed her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms, where Cindy had spent over a decade in voluntary confinement shortly after getting her powers, in order to avoid drawing Morlun\\'s attention. While Peter notified Cindy that Morlun was dead, he had in fact survived his last encounter against Spider-Man. [104] Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own superheroic identity as Silk, [105] Spider-Man was approached by a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires and the family of Morlun that had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities. [106] During a mission to gather more recruits in A.D. 2099, the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by Otto Octavius, or rather a version of him from the recent past who had been plucked out of time. [107] The combined Spider-Army were forced to retreat to Earth-3145 after their safe zone in Earth-13 had been compromised by the Inheritors, namely Morlun, his brother Jennix, and his father and leader of the Inheritors, Solus. With the help of Spider-Woman, who had previously infiltrated the Inheritor\\'s base on Earth-001, the Spider-Army learned of a prophecy in which the Inheritors planned to sacrifice three key spiders: the Other, the Bride, and the Scion. These individuals were Kaine Parker, Cindy Moon, and Benjamin \"Benjy\" Parker of Earth-982, respectively.\\nWith the help of even more recruits from other realities and even a deviant Inheritor named Karn, the Spider-Army, including a version of Gwen Stacy with spider-powers known as \"Spider-Gwen\", launched one final attack on the Inheritors\\' home of Earth-001. The ritual was stopped, and the Inheritors were exiled with no means to return home to the radioactive wasteland that had become the world of Earth-3145. With the Inheritors neutralized, most of the spider-totems were sent home. Spider-Man and a few others stayed on Earth-001 for a little while longer to defeat the time-displaced Octavius, who had gone rogue after learning that Parker would eventually regain control of his body. Octavius was defeated and returned to the time he had come from, losing memory of the recent events in the process. With no more problems to confront, Spider-Man and the rest of the spiders were sent back home.  \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" [ edit ]  Unbeknownst to anyone, Otto Octavius had created a digital back-up of his own mind, which ended up inhabiting the metallic body of Parker Industries\\' robotic assistant, the Living Brain. [108] Over the course of the following months, Octavius routinely hacked into the systems of the market share to manipulate its numbers in favor of Parker Industries. As a consequence of this, the company managed to expand into a global conglomerate with numerous bases in different countries, with the company\\'s trademark invention being a mobile device called the Webware. This change in Peter\\'s life impacted his superheroic alter ego as well. Spider-Man officially became the mascot of Parker Industries under the guise of being Peter\\'s bodyguard. [109]  One of Peter\\'s biggest challenges during his tenure as a billionaire C.E.O was the emergence of a mysterious biotech company, operating out of the Transamerica Pyramid, called New U. Peter discovered it was a front for the operations of the Jackal, who claimed to have found a way to bring people back from the dead using cloning technology. In an attempt to persuade Peter to put Parker Industries\\' resources to help his plan, the Jackal created numerous clones of his late friends and foes, including Gwen Stacy. In a turn of events, the Jackal was revealed to be Ben Reilly, who had been brought to life by the original Jackal before taking his place. The Jackal\\'s plan eventually fell apart following the triggering of cellular decay in the clones created by New U, which led to the release of the Carrion Virus worldwide. The crisis was adverted when Spider-Man had his Webwares transmit an audio frequency in a global scale which halted the cellular degeneration, but not before most of the clones died. The Jackal, being a clone himself, was left for dead, though he secretly escaped and returned to the mantle of the Scarlet Spider.  \"Fresh Start\" [ edit ]  Following the death of Flash Thompson and Osborn\\'s latest defeat , Peter\\'s life was plagued with problems on both sides. As Spider-Man, now-Mayor Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. the Kingpin, decided to be publicly accepting of him, while condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate him from his superhero peers. As Peter Parker, his academic credentials were revoked after being accused of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius (and unable to defend himself without revealing his secret identity), resulting in his firing from the Daily Bugle again. On the other hand, Peter became romantically involved again with Mary Jane, and was given an opportunity to re-apply for his doctoral thesis on the recommendation of Dr. Curt Connors. [110] For a brief time, Peter Parker and Spider-Man were split into separate beings due to an accident involving the reverse-engineered Isotope Genome Accelerator. However, the separation split Peter down the middle, so both individuals did not share Peter\\'s sense of responsibility, resulting in a reckless and vain Spider-Man. Peter eventually managed to reverse the process, and merge his two halves back together before the side-effects could worsen and result in their death. [111]  More recently, Spider-Man has been plagued by visions of a mysterious villain named Kindred who has seemingly been working with Mysterio. [112] As this happened, villains the Black Ant and the Taskmaster captured animal-themed supervillains for Kraven the Hunter as part of a plan to destroy unworthy hunters. In the process, Dr. Connors\\' child Billy was kidnapped alongside the Black Cat and were forced to fight for their survival in New York\\'s Central Park which was, at that time, surrounded by an energy field. [113] Meanwhile, the Vulture brainwashed a group of fellow supervillains and led an attack against the unworthy hunters. Spider-Man was tasked with finding Kraven the Hunter, whose ultimate goal through the hunt was to anger Spider-Man and lead him to kill him, ending his curse. After Spider-Man refused and Dr. Connors saved his child, Kraven lifted the force field from Central Park, allowing Spider-Man, Connors and Billy, and the Black Cat to escape while the Avengers rounded up all the loose criminals. The \" Hunted \" story arc ended with Kraven donning a Spider-Man disguise, effectively becoming the Spider, and allowing his cloned son to kill him.

What Lee and Ditko actually did in The Amazing Spider-Man was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead character\\'s life. Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers\\' lives than thwarting this month\\'s bad guys... Parker had far more serious concern in his life: coming to terms with the death of a loved one, falling in love for the first time, struggling to make a living, and undergoing crises of conscience.\"  Comics historian Peter Sanderson [115]    Sally Kempton for the Village Voice opined in 1965 that \"Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked inferiority complex , and a fear of women. He is anti-social , [ sic ] castration-ridden , racked with Oedipal guilt , and accident-prone ... [a] functioning neurotic \". [48] Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal. [116]  Notes cultural historian Bradford W. Wright,  Spider-Man\\'s plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of The Amazing Spider-Man , J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the Daily Bugle , launches an editorial campaign against the \"Spider-Man menace.\" The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson\\'s Daily Bugle . [9] : 212  The mid-1960s stories reflected the political tensions of the time, as early 1960s Marvel stories had often dealt with the Cold War and Communism . [9] : 220–223 As Wright observes,  From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant student demonstrations at Columbia University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives. [9] : 234–235  Powers, skills, and equipment [ edit ]  Peter Parker has superhuman abilities derived from mutations resulting from the bite of a radioactive spider. [117] Since the original Lee - Ditko stories, Spider-Man has had the ability to cling to walls. This has been speculated to be based on a distance-dependent interaction between his body and surfaces, known as the van der Waals force , [ citation needed ] though in the 2002 Spider-Man film, his hands and feet are lined with tiny clinging cilia in the manner of a real spider\\'s feet. Spider-Man\\'s other powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility and balance, a precognitive sixth sense referred to as his \"Spider-Sense,\" which alerts him to danger. [117] In the aftermath of the 1989 \" Acts of Vengeance \" storyline, Spider-Man was said to have \"superhuman recuperative abilities\" that sped up his recovery from the exhaustion he suffered in defeating the Tri-Sentinel. [118] The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level. [119] Academically brilliant, Parker has expertise in the fields of applied science , chemistry , physics , biology , engineering , mathematics , and mechanics . With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters, to help navigate and trap his enemies along with a spider-signal as a flashlight and a warning beacon to criminals. [117]   Supporting cast [ edit ]  Main articles: List of Spider-Man supporting characters and List of incarnations of Spider-Man   Spider-Man has had a wide range of connected characters during his inception. The Amazing Spider-Man #121 cover art featuring a collage of Spider-Man facing his supporting characters (art by John Romita Sr ) as displayed in the left. A variant cover art of The Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 3) #1 depicts the heads of various Spider-Man enemies behind Spider-Man (as drawn by Kevin Maguire ) as shown in the center. In the right, Spider-Man is shown along with his many spider-themed family and alternate universe versions of himself in Spider-Geddon #1 (art by Jorge Molina).  Spider-Man has had a large range of supporting characters introduced in the comics that are essential in the issues and storylines that star him. After his parents died, Peter Parker was raised by his loving aunt, May Parker , and his uncle and father figure, Ben Parker . After Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar , Aunt May is virtually Peter\\'s only family, and she and Peter are very close. [49]  J. Jonah Jameson is the publisher of the Daily Bugle and Peter Parker\\'s boss. A harsh critic of Spider-Man, he constantly features negative articles about the superhero in his newspaper. Despite his role as Jameson\\'s editor and confidant, Robbie Robertson is always depicted as a supporter of both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. [51]  Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson is commonly depicted as Parker\\'s high school tormentor and bully , but in later comic issues he becomes a friend to Peter and adopts his own superhero identity, Agent Venom, after merging with the Venom  symbiote . [51] Meanwhile, Harry Osborn , son of Norman Osborn, is most commonly recognized as Peter\\'s best friend, some versions depicted him as his rival. [53]   Enemies [ edit ]  Writers and artists over the years have established a rogues gallery of supervillains to face Spider-Man , in comics and in other media . As with the hero, the majority of the villains\\' powers originate with scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology, and many have animal-themed costumes or powers. [note 6] The most notable Spider-Man villains are listed down below in the ordering of their original chronological appearance:   .mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend-color{display:inline-block;min-width:1.25em;height:1.25em;line-height:1.25;margin:1px 0;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:transparent;color:black}.mw-parser-output .legend-text{}   Indicates a group.

Instead, he is often regarded as having three archenemies, and it can be debated as to which one is the worst: [170]   ^ Doctor Octopus (a.k.a. Doc Ock) is a highly intelligent mad scientist who utilizes four mechanical appendages for both movement and combat. He has been described as Spider-Man\\'s greatest enemy, and the man Peter Parker might have become if he had not been raised with a sense of responsibility. [16] [171] Doc Ock is infamous for defeating him the first time in battle and for almost marrying Peter\\'s Aunt May . He is also the core leader of the Sinister Six , and at one point adopted the \"Master Planner\" alias. (\" If This Be My Destiny...! \") [172] Later depictions revealed him in Peter Parker\\'s body where he was the titular character for a while . [171]  ^ The Norman Osborn version of the Green Goblin is most commonly regarded as Spider-Man\\'s archenemy. [170] [173] [174] While Norman is usually portrayed as an amoral industrialist and the head of the Oscorp scientific corporation, the Goblin is a psychopatic alternate personality, born after Norman\\'s exposore to some unstable chemicals that also increased his strength and agility. The Goblin is a Halloween -themed villain, dressing up like an actual goblin and utilizing a large arsenal of high tech weapons, including a glider and pumpkin-shaped exposives. Unlike most villains, who only aim to kill Spider-Man, the Goblin also targeted his loved ones and showed no remorse in killing them as long as it caused pain to Spider-Man, therefore making him not only Spider-Man\\'s worst enemy, but also Peter Parker\\'s. His most infamous feat is killing Spider-Man\\'s girlfriend in what became one of the most famous Spider-Man stories of all time and helped end the Silver Age of Comic Books and begin the Bronze Age of Comic Books . [170] While the Goblin was killed in the same story, he returned in the 1990s to plague Spider-Man once again, committing more heinous acts (such as being involved in the murder of Aunt May). He also came into conflict with other heroes , such as the Avengers . [175] Norman is sometimes depicted as an enemy of Spider-Man even when not being the Green Goblin. [176]  ^ The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom is often regarded as Spider-Man\\'s deadliest foe, and has been described as an evil mirror version of Spider-Man in many ways. [162] [121] [170] He is also among Spider-Man\\'s most popular villains. [177] Originally a photographer who grew to despise Spider-Man, Eddie later came into contact with the Venom symbiote, which had been rejected by Spider-Man. The symbiote merged with Eddie and gave him the same powers as Spider-Man, in addition to making him immune to the web-slinger\\'s \"spider-sense\". Venom\\'s main goal is usually to ruin Peter Parker\\'s life and mess with his head in any way he can. [165] Despite this, Venom is not a traditional criminal, as he is only interested in hurting Spider-Man and does not engage in criminal acts, lacking the typical supervillain desires for wealth and power. The character also has a sense of honor and justice, and later starred in his own comic book stories , where he is depicted as an antihero and has a desire to protect innocent people from harm. On several occasions, he and Spider-Man even put their differences aside and became allies. [162] [178]  Romantic interests [ edit ]  Peter Parker\\'s romantic interests range between his first crush, fellow high-school student Liz Allan , [51] to having his first date with Betty Brant , [179] secretary to the Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson. After his breakup with Betty Brant, Parker eventually falls in love with his college girlfriend Gwen Stacy , [53] [56] daughter of New York City Police Department detective captain George Stacy , both of whom are later killed by supervillain enemies of Spider-Man. [61]  Mary Jane Watson eventually became Peter\\'s best friend and then his wife. [72] Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat , is a reformed cat burglar who had been Spider-Man\\'s sole superhuman girlfriend and partner at one point. [68]   Alternate versions of Spider-Man [ edit ]  Main article: Alternative versions of Spider-Man  Within the Marvel Universe there exists a multiverse with many variations of Spider-Men. [180] An early character included in the 1980s is the fictional anthropomorphic  funny animal  parody of Spider-Man in pig form named Spider-Ham (Peter Porker). [181] Many imprints of Spider-Men were created, like the futuristic version of Spider-Man in Marvel 2099 named Miguel O\\'Hara . In the MC2 imprint, Peter marries Mary Jane and has a daughter named Mayday Parker , who carries on Spider-Man\\'s legacy and Marvel Noir has a 1930s version of Peter Parker . [180] [182] [183] Other themed versions exist within the early 2000s, such as a Marvel Mangaverse version and an Indian version from Spider-Man: India named Pavitr Prabhakar. [180] [184]  Ultimate Spider-Man was a popular modern retelling of Peter Parker. The version of Parker would later be depicted as being killed off and replaced by an Afro-Latino Spider-Man named Miles Morales . [185]  The storyline \" Spider-Verse \" brought back many alternate takes on Spider-Man and introduced many newly inspired ones, such as an alternate world where Gwen Stacy gets bitten by a radioactive spider instead, along with a British-themed version named Spider-UK called Billy Braddock from the Captain Britain Corps . [182] [186]   Cultural influence and legacy [ edit ]   Graph image depicting Spider-Man as the leading superhero in merchandise retail sales worldwide in 2016 (in millions) [187]  In The Creation of Spider-Man , comic book writer-editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character\\'s superpowers \"nothing too original\"; what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a \"nerdy high school student\". [188] : 5 Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included \"heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama\". Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics: \"the flawed superhero with everyday problems\". This idea spawned a \"comics revolution\". [188] : 6 The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel\\'s early 1960s comic books, such as The Amazing Spider-Man , The Incredible Hulk , The Fantastic Four , and The X-Men ushered in a new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public\\'s perception of them. [189] Spider-Man has become one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world, and has been used to sell toys, games, cereal, candy, soap, and many other products. [190]  Spider-Man has become Marvel\\'s flagship character and has often been used as the company mascot. When Marvel became the first comic book company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991, The Wall Street Journal announced \"Spider-Man is coming to Wall Street \"; the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a Spider-Man costume accompanying Stan Lee to the Stock Exchange. [9] : 254 Since 1962, hundreds of millions of comics featuring the character have been sold around the world. [191] Spider-Man is the world\\'s most profitable superhero. [192] In 2014, global retail sales of licensed products related to Spider-Man reached approximately $1.3 billion. [193] Comparatively, this amount exceeds the global licensing revenue of Batman , Superman , and the Avengers combined. [192] Spider-Man is also one of the highest-grossing franchise titles being the highest-grossing American comic book superhero [194] [195]   est. $25.6 billion worldwide. [196] [197]    U.S. President Barack Obama pretending to be webbed up by a boy dressed in a Spider-Man costume inside the White House  Spider-Man joined the Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1987 to 1998 as one of the balloon floats, [198] designed by John Romita Sr. , [199] one of the character\\'s signature artists. A new, different Spider-Man balloon float also appeared from 2009 to 2014. [198]  In 1992, Spider-Man was homaged by Italian band 883 \\'s song \" Hanno ucciso l\\'Uomo Ragno \", describing the possible aftermath of Spider-Man\\'s murder on New York City. When Marvel wanted to issue a story dealing with the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks , the company chose the December 2001 issue of The Amazing Spider-Man . [200] In 2006, Spider-Man garnered major media coverage with the revelation of the character\\'s secret identity, [201] an event detailed in a full-page story in the New York Post before the issue containing the story was even released. [202]  In 2008, Marvel announced plans to release a series of educational comics the following year in partnership with the United Nations, depicting Spider-Man alongside the UN Peacekeeping Forces to highlight UN peacekeeping missions. [203] A BusinessWeek article listed Spider-Man as one of the top 10 most intelligent fictional characters in American comics. [204]  Rapper Eminem has cited Spider-Man as one of his favorite comic book superheroes. [205] [206]  In 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC , a case concerning royalties on a patent for an imitation web-shooter. The opinion for the Court, by Justice Elena Kagan , included several Spider-Man references, concluding with the statement that \"with great power there must also come—great responsibility\". [207]  Spider-Man has become a subject of scientific inquiry. In 1987, researchers at Loyola University conducted a study into the utility of Spider-Man comics for informing children and parents about issues relating to child abuse . [208] In 2019, an Israeli study from Ariel University and Bar-Ilan University suggested that exposure to short clips from the Spider-Man movies could help to reduce an individual\\'s arachnophobia . [209]   Reception [ edit ]   The culmination of nearly every superhero that came before him, Spider-Man is the hero of heroes. He\\'s got fun and cool powers, but not on the god-like level of Thor . He\\'s just a normal guy with girlfriend problems and money issues, so he\\'s more relatable than playboy billionaire Iron Man . And he\\'s an awkward teenager, not a wizened adult like Captain America . Not too hot and not too cold, Spider-Man is just right.  —IGN staff on placing Spider-Man as the number one hero of Marvel. [210]    Spider-Man was declared the number 1 superhero on Bravo \\'s Ultimate Super Heroes, Vixens, and Villains TV series in 2005. [211]  Empire magazine placed him as the fifth-greatest comic book character of all time. [212]  Wizard magazine placed Spider-Man as the third-greatest comic book character on their website. [213] In 2011, Spider-Man placed third on IGN \\'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time, behind DC Comics characters Superman and Batman . [210] and sixth in their 2012 list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\". [214] In 2014, IGN identified Spider-Man the greatest Marvel Comics character of all time. [215] A 2015 poll at Comic Book Resources named Spider-Man the greatest Marvel character of all time. [216] IGN described him as the common everyman that represents many normal people, but also noting his uniqueness compared to many top-tiered superheroes with his many depicted flaws as a superhero. IGN noted that, despite being one of the most tragic superheroes of all time, he is \"one of the most fun and snarky superheroes in existence.\" [210]  Empire noted and praised that, despite the many tragedies that Spider-Man faces, he retains his sense of humor at all times with his witty wisecracks. The magazine website appraised the depiction of his \"iconic\" superhero poses describing it as \"a top artist\\'s dream\". [213]  George Marston of Newsarama placed Spider-Man\\'s origin story as the greatest origin story of all time opining that \"Spider-Man\\'s origin combines all of the most classic aspects of pathos, tragedy and scientific wonder into the perfect blend for a superhero origin.\" [217]   Real-life comparisons [ edit ]  Real-life people who have been compared to Spider-Man for their climbing feats include:  In 1981, skyscraper-safety activist Dan Goodwin , wearing a Spider-Man suit, scaled the Sears Tower in Chicago , Illinois , the Renaissance Tower in Dallas , Texas , and the John Hancock Center in Chicago. [218]  Alain Robert , nicknamed \"Spider-Man\", is a rock and urban climber who has scaled more than 70 tall buildings using his hands and feet, without using additional devices. He sometimes wears a Spider-Man suit during his climbs. In May 2003, he was paid approximately $18,000 to climb the 95-metre (312\\xa0ft) Lloyd\\'s building to promote the premiere of the movie Spider-Man on the British television channel Sky Movies .  \"The Human Spider\", alias Bill Strother, scaled the Lamar Building in Augusta, Georgia in 1921. [219]  In Argentina, criminals that climb buildings and trespass into private property through the open balconies are said to use the \"Spider-Man method\" (in Spanish, \"el Hombre Araña\").

Nobody likes spiders; it sounds too much like Superman; and how could a teenager be a superhero? Then I told him I wanted the character to be a very human guy, someone who makes mistakes, who worries, who gets acne, has trouble with his girlfriend, things like that. [Goodman replied,] \\'He\\'s a hero! He\\'s not an average man!\\' I said, \\'No, we make him an average man who happens to have super powers, that\\'s what will make him good.\\' He told me I was crazy\".   ^  Ditko, Steve (2000).

ISBN  978-1-893905-06-1 . \"\\'Stan said a new Marvel hero would be introduced in #15 [of what became titled Amazing Fantasy ]. He would be called Spider-Man. Jack would do the penciling and I was to ink the character.\\' At this point still, Stan said Spider-Man would be a teenager with a magic ring which could transform him into an adult hero—Spider-Man. I said it sounded like the Fly , which Joe Simon had done for Archie Comics . Stan called Jack about it but I don\\'t know what was discussed. I never talked to Jack about Spider-Man... Later, at some point, I was given the job of drawing Spider-Man\\'\".   ^  Jack Kirby in \"Shop Talk: Jack Kirby\", Will Eisner \\'s Spirit Magazine #39 (February 1982): \"Spider-Man was discussed between Joe Simon and myself. It was the last thing Joe and I had discussed. We had a strip called \\'The Silver Spider.\\' The Silver Spider was going into a magazine called Black Magic.  Black Magic folded with Crestwood (Simon & Kirby\\'s 1950s comics company) and we were left with the script. I believe I said this could become a thing called Spider-Man, see, a superhero character. I had a lot of faith in the superhero character that they could be brought back... and I said Spider-Man would be a fine character to start with. But Joe had already moved on. So the idea was already there when I talked to Stan\".   ^  Simon, Joe, with Jim Simon. The Comic Book Makers (Crestwood/II, 1990) ISBN  1-887591-35-4 . \"There were a few holes in Jack\\'s never-dependable memory. For instance, there was no Black Magic involved at all. ... Jack brought in the Spider-Man logo that I had loaned to him before we changed the name to The Silver Spider. Kirby laid out the story to Lee about the kid who finds a ring in a spiderweb, gets his powers from the ring, and goes forth to fight crime armed with The Silver Spider\\'s old web-spinning pistol. Stan Lee said, \\'Perfect, just what I want.\\' After obtaining permission from publisher Martin Goodman , Lee told Kirby to pencil-up an origin story. Kirby... using parts of an old rejected superhero named Night Fighter... revamped the old Silver Spider script, including revisions suggested by Lee. But when Kirby showed Lee the sample pages, it was Lee\\'s turn to gripe. He had been expecting a skinny young kid who is transformed into a skinny young kid with spider powers. Kirby had him turn into... Captain America with cobwebs. He turned Spider-Man over to Steve Ditko, who... ignored Kirby\\'s pages, tossed the character\\'s magic ring, web-pistol and goggles... and completely redesigned Spider-Man\\'s costume and equipment. In this life, he became high-school student Peter Parker, who gets his spider powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. ... Lastly, the Spider-Man logo was redone and a dashing hyphen added\".   ^  Mondello, Salvatore (March 2004). \"Spider-Man: Superhero in the Liberal Tradition\". The Journal of Popular Culture .

He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become Marvel Comics \\' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and movie industries. In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko —he co-created numerous popular fictional characters, including superheroes  Spider-Man , the X-Men , Iron Man , Thor , the Hulk , Ant-Man , the Wasp , the Fantastic Four , Black Panther , Daredevil , Doctor Strange , Scarlet Witch , the Black Widow and Captain Marvel . These and other characters\\' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach than previously applied to superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority , indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results. Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, he remained a public figurehead for the company, and frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel characters , on which he received an executive producer credit. Meanwhile, he continued independent creative ventures into his 90s, until his death in 2018. Lee was inducted into the comic book industry\\'s Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA \\'s National Medal of Arts in 2008.  .mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none} Contents   1  Personal life   1.1  Early life  1.2  Marriage and residences  1.3  Philanthropy  1.4  Sexual harassment allegations  1.5  Later years and death    2  Publishing career   2.1  Early career  2.2  Marvel Comics   2.2.1  Marvel revolution  2.2.2  Later Marvel years    2.3  Beyond Marvel  2.4  Legal concerns   2.4.1  Intellectual property  2.4.2  Victim of elder abuse      3  Bibliography   3.1  Books  3.2  Comics bibliography   3.2.1  DC Comics  3.2.2  Marvel Comics  3.2.3  Simon and Schuster  3.2.4  Other      4  Cultural impact   4.1  Accolades  4.2  Fictional portrayals   4.2.1  Marvel Comics  4.2.2  DC Comics  4.2.3  Other publishers    4.3  Film and television appearances    5  See also  6  Explanatory notes  7  References  8  Further reading  9  External links     Personal life [ edit ]  Early life [ edit ]  Stanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922, in Manhattan , New York City, [2] in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents, Celia ( née Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue . [3] [4] Lee was raised in a Jewish household, and in a 2002 interview, he stated when asked if he believed in God, \"Well, let me put it this way... [Pauses.] No, I\\'m not going to try to be clever. I really don\\'t know. I just don\\'t know.\" [5] On another interview from 2011, when asked about his Romanian origins and his relationship with the country, he said that he had never visited it and that he did not know Romanian because his parents never taught it to him. [6] Lee\\'s father, trained as a dress cutter , worked only sporadically after the Great Depression , [3] and the family moved further uptown to Fort Washington Avenue , [7] in Washington Heights, Manhattan . Lee had one younger brother named Larry Lieber . [8] He said in 2006 that as a child he was influenced by books and movies, particularly those with Errol Flynn playing heroic roles. [9] By the time Lee was in his teens, the family was living in an apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The Bronx . Lee described it as \"a third-floor apartment facing out back\". Lee and his brother shared the bedroom, while their parents slept on a foldout couch. [8]  Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. [10] In his youth, Lee enjoyed writing and entertained dreams of writing the \" Great American Novel \" one day. [11] He said that in his youth he worked such part-time jobs as writing obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National Tuberculosis Center; [12] delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center ; working as an office boy for a trouser manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway ; [13] and selling subscriptions to the New York Herald Tribune newspaper. [14] At fifteen, Lee entered a high school essay competition sponsored by the New York Herald Tribune , called \"The Biggest News of the Week Contest.\" Lee claimed to have won the prize for three straight weeks, goading the newspaper to write him and ask him to let someone else win. The paper suggested he look into writing professionally, which Lee claimed \"probably changed my life.\" [15] He graduated from high school early, aged sixteen and a half, in 1939 and joined the WPA  Federal Theatre Project . [16]   Marriage and residences [ edit ]  From 1945 to 1947, Lee lived in the rented top floor of a brownstone in the East 90s in Manhattan. [17] He married Joan Clayton Boocock , originally from Newcastle , England, [18] on December 5, 1947, [19] [20] and in 1949, the couple bought a house in Woodmere, New York , on Long Island , living there through 1952. [21] Their daughter Joan Celia \"J. C.\" Lee was born in 1950. Another daughter, Jan Lee, died a few days after her birth in 1953. [22]  The Lees resided in the Long Island town of Hewlett Harbor, New York , from 1952 to 1980. [23] They also owned a condominium on East 63rd Street in Manhattan from 1975 to 1980, [24] and during the 1970s owned a vacation home in Remsenburg, New York . [25] For their move to the West Coast in 1981, they bought a home in West Hollywood, California , previously owned by comedian Jack Benny \\'s radio announcer Don Wilson . [26]   Philanthropy [ edit ]  The Stan Lee Foundation was founded in 2010 to focus on literacy, education, and the arts. Its stated goals include supporting programs and ideas that improve access to literacy resources, as well as promoting diversity, national literacy, culture and the arts. [27]  Lee donated portions of his personal effects to the University of Wyoming at various times, between 1981 and 2001. [28]   Sexual harassment allegations [ edit ]  in January 10, 2018, Lee was accused by multiple nurses of sexually harassing them at his home in early 2017. [29]  Six celebrities came out in support of Lee and his allegations, including Joe Rogan , Kevin Smith , Seth Green , Felicia Day , Kevin Feige and James Gunn .  Later years and death [ edit ]  In September 2012, Lee underwent an operation to insert a pacemaker , which required cancelling planned appearances at conventions. [30] [31] Lee eventually retired from convention appearances by 2017. [32]  On July 6, 2017, his wife of 69 years, Joan, died of complications from a stroke . She was 95 years old. [33]  Lee died on November 12, 2018, six weeks before his 96th birthday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles , California , after being rushed there in a medical emergency earlier in the day. [34] [35] [36] Earlier that year, Lee revealed to the public that he had been battling pneumonia and in February was rushed to the hospital for worsening conditions at around the same time. [37] The immediate cause of death listed on his death certificate was cardiac arrest with respiratory failure and congestive heart failure as underlying causes. It also indicated that he suffered from aspiration pneumonia . His body was cremated and his ashes were given to his daughter. [38]  Roy Thomas , who succeeded Lee as editor-in-chief at Marvel, had visited Lee two days prior to his death to discuss the upcoming book The Stan Lee Story , and stated \"I think he was ready to go. But he was still talking about doing more cameos. As long as he had the energy for it and didn\\'t have to travel, Stan was always up to do some more cameos. He got a kick out of those more than anything else.\" [39]   Publishing career [ edit ]  Early career [ edit ]  With the help of his uncle Robbie Solomon, [40] Lee became an assistant in 1939 at the new Timely Comics division belonging to pulp magazine and comic-book publisher Martin Goodman . Timely, by the 1960s, would evolve into Marvel Comics. Lee, whose cousin Jean [41] was Goodman\\'s wife, was formally hired by Timely editor Joe Simon . [n 1]  His duties were prosaic at first. \"In those days [the artists] dipped the pen in ink, [so] I had to make sure the inkwells were filled\", Lee recalled in 2009. \"I went down and got them their lunch, I did proofreading, I erased the pencils from the finished pages for them\". [43] Marshaling his childhood ambition to be a writer, young Stanley Lieber made his comic-book debut with the text filler \" Captain America Foils the Traitor\\'s Revenge\" in Captain America Comics #3 ( cover-dated May 1941), using the pseudonym Stan Lee (a play on his first name, \"Stanley\"), [44] which years later he would adopt as his legal name. [45] Lee later explained in his autobiography and numerous other sources that because of the low social status of comic books, he was so embarrassed that he used a pen name so nobody would associate his real name with comics when he wrote the Great American Novel one day. [46] This initial story also introduced Captain America\\'s trademark ricocheting shield-toss. [47] : 11  Lee graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature, \"\\'Headline\\' Hunter, Foreign Correspondent\", two issues later. His first superhero co-creation was the Destroyer , in Mystic Comics #6 (August 1941). Other characters he co-created during this period, called the Golden Age of Comic Books , include Jack Frost , debuting in U.S.A. Comics #1 (August 1941), and Father Time , debuting in Captain America Comics #6 (August 1941). [47] : 12–13  When Simon and his creative partner Jack Kirby left in late 1941 following a dispute with Goodman, the 30-year-old publisher installed Lee, just under 19 years old, as interim editor. [47] : 14 [48] The youngster showed a knack for the business that led him to remain as the comic-book division\\'s editor-in-chief, as well as art director for much of that time, until 1972, when he would succeed Goodman as publisher. [49] [50]    Lee in the Army, early 1940s  Lee entered the United States Army in early 1942 and served within the US as a member of the Signal Corps , repairing telegraph poles and other communications equipment. [51] He was later transferred to the Training Film Division, where he worked writing manuals, training films , slogans, and occasionally cartooning . [52] His military classification, he said, was \" playwright \"; he added that only nine men in the U.S. Army were given that title. [53] In the Army, Lee\\'s division included many famous or soon-to-be famous people, including three-time Academy Award -winning director Frank Capra , New Yorker cartoonist Charles Addams , and children\\'s book writer and illustrator Theodor Geisel , later known to the world as \"Dr. Seuss.\" [54]  Vincent Fago , editor of Timely\\'s \"animation comics\" section, which put out humor and funny animal comics, filled in until Lee returned from his World War II military service in 1945. Lee was inducted into the Signal Corps Regimental Association and was given honorary membership of the 2nd Battalion of 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord at the 2017 Emerald City Comic Con for his prior service. [55]  While in the Army, Lee received letters every week on Friday from the editors at Timely, detailing what they needed written and by when. Lee would write stories, then send them back on Monday. One week, the mail clerk overlooked his letter, explaining that nothing was in Lee\\'s mailbox. The next day, however, Lee went by the closed mailroom and saw an envelope with the return address of Timely Comics in his mailbox. Not willing to miss a deadline, Lee asked the officer in charge to open the mailroom, but the latter refused. So Lee took a screwdriver and unscrewed the mailbox hinges, retrieving the envelope containing his assignment. The mailroom officer saw what he did and turned him into the base captain, who did not like Lee. He faced tampering charges and could have been sent to Leavenworth Prison . However, the colonel in charge of the Finance Department intervened and saved Lee from disciplinary action. [56]  In the mid-1950s, by which time the company was now generally known as Atlas Comics , Lee wrote stories in a variety of genres including romance , Westerns , humor, science fiction, medieval adventure, horror and suspense. In the 1950s, Lee teamed up with his comic book colleague Dan DeCarlo to produce the syndicated newspaper strip My Friend Irma , based on the radio comedy starring Marie Wilson . [57] By the end of the decade, Lee had become dissatisfied with his career and considered quitting the field. [58] [59]   Marvel Comics [ edit ]  Marvel revolution [ edit ]  In the late 1950s, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz revived the superhero archetype and experienced significant success with an updated version of the Flash , and later with the Justice League of America super-team. In response, publisher Martin Goodman assigned Lee to come up with a new superhero team. Lee\\'s wife suggested that he experiment with stories he preferred, since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose. Lee acted on the advice, giving his superheroes a flawed humanity, a change from the ideal archetypes typically written for preteens. Before this, most superheroes had been idealistically perfect people with no serious, lasting problems. [60] Lee introduced complex, naturalistic characters [61] who could have bad tempers, fits of melancholy, and vanity; they bickered amongst themselves, worried about paying their bills and impressing girlfriends, got bored or sometimes even physically ill. The first superheroes Lee and artist Jack Kirby created together were the Fantastic Four . The team\\'s immediate popularity [62] led Lee and Marvel\\'s illustrators to produce a cavalcade of new titles. Again working with Kirby, Lee co-created the Hulk , [63]  Thor , [64]  Iron Man , [65] and the X-Men ; [66] with Bill Everett , Daredevil ; [67] and with Steve Ditko , Doctor Strange [68] and Marvel\\'s most successful character, Spider-Man , [69] all of whom lived in a thoroughly shared universe . [70] Lee and Kirby gathered several of their newly created characters together into the team title The Avengers [71] and would revive characters from the 1940s such as the Sub-Mariner [72] and Captain America. [73] Years later, Kirby and Lee would contest who deserved credit for creating The Fantastic Four . [74]  Comics historian Peter Sanderson wrote that in the 1960s:  .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} DC was the equivalent of the big Hollywood studios: After the brilliance of DC\\'s reinvention of the superhero ... in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it had run into a creative drought by the decade\\'s end. There was a new audience for comics now, and it wasn\\'t just the little kids that traditionally had read the books. The Marvel of the 1960s was in its own way the counterpart of the French New Wave ... Marvel was pioneering new methods of comics storytelling and characterization, addressing more serious themes, and in the process keeping and attracting readers in their teens and beyond. Moreover, among this new generation of readers were people who wanted to write or draw comics themselves, within the new style that Marvel had pioneered, and push the creative envelope still further. [75]  Lee\\'s revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators. [76] He introduced the practice of regularly including a credit panel on the splash page of each story, naming not just the writer and penciller but also the inker and letterer. Regular news about Marvel staff members and upcoming storylines was presented on the Bullpen Bulletins page, which (like the letter columns that appeared in each title) was written in a friendly, chatty style. Lee remarked that his goal was for fans to think of the comics creators as friends, and considered it a mark of his success on this front that, at a time when letters to other comics publishers were typically addressed \"Dear Editor\", letters to Marvel addressed the creators by first name (e.g., \"Dear Stan and Jack\"). Lee recorded messages to the newly formed Merry Marvel Marching Society fan club in 1965. [77] By 1967, the brand was well-enough ensconced in popular culture that a March 3 WBAI radio program with Lee and Kirby as guests was titled \"Will Success Spoil Spiderman [sic]\". [78]  Throughout the 1960s, Lee scripted, art-directed and edited most of Marvel\\'s series, moderated the letters pages, wrote a monthly column called \" Stan\\'s Soapbox \", and wrote endless promotional copy, often signing off with his trademark motto, \" Excelsior !\" (which is also the New York state motto ). To maintain his workload and meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee\\'s success with it, became known as the \" Marvel Method \". Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling. After the artist turned in penciled pages, Lee would write the word balloons and captions, and then oversee the lettering and coloring. In effect, the artists were co-plotters, whose collaborative first drafts Lee built upon. Following Ditko\\'s departure from Marvel in 1966, John Romita Sr. became Lee\\'s collaborator on The Amazing Spider-Man . Within a year, it overtook Fantastic Four to become the company\\'s top seller. [79] Lee and Romita\\'s stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man\\'s adventures. [80] The stories became more topical, addressing issues such as the Vietnam War , [81] political elections, [82] and student activism . [83]  Robbie Robertson , introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #51 (August 1967) was one of the first African-American characters in comics to play a serious supporting role. [84] In the Fantastic Four series, the lengthy run by Lee and Kirby produced many acclaimed storylines as well as characters that have become central to Marvel, including the Inhumans [85] [86] and the Black Panther , [87] an African king who would be mainstream comics\\' first black superhero. [88]  The story frequently cited as Lee and Kirby\\'s finest achievement [89] [90] is the three-part \" Galactus Trilogy \" that began in Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966), chronicling the arrival of Galactus , a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet, and his herald, the Silver Surfer . [91] [92]  Fantastic Four #48 was chosen as #24 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel\\'s readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that \"As the fourth year of the Fantastic Four came to a close, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby seemed to be only warming up. In retrospect, it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the Marvel Age.\" [93] Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \"[t]he mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the 1960s\", and Lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses. [94] Lee and artist John Buscema launched The Silver Surfer series in August 1968. [95] [96]  The following year, Lee and Gene Colan created the Falcon , comics\\' first African-American superhero, in Captain America #117 (September 1969). [97] In 1971, Lee indirectly helped reform the Comics Code . [98] The U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare had asked Lee to write a comic-book story about the dangers of drugs and Lee conceived a three-issue subplot in The Amazing Spider-Man #96–98 ( cover-dated May–July 1971), in which Peter Parker\\'s best friend becomes addicted to prescription drugs. The Comics Code Authority refused to grant its seal because the stories depicted drug use; the anti-drug context was considered irrelevant. With Goodman\\'s cooperation and confident that the original government request would give him credibility, Lee had the story published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts. [99] The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms. [100] [101]  Lee also supported using comic books to provide some measure of social commentary about the real world, often dealing with racism and bigotry . [102] \"Stan\\'s Soapbox\", besides promoting an upcoming comic book project, also addressed issues of discrimination, intolerance, or prejudice. [103] [104]  In 1972, Lee stopped writing monthly comic books to assume the role of publisher. His final issue of The Amazing Spider-Man was #110 (July 1972) [105] and his last Fantastic Four was #125 (August 1972). [106]   Later Marvel years [ edit ]   Lee in 1975  Lee became a figurehead and public face for Marvel Comics. He made appearances at comic book conventions around America, lecturing at colleges and participating in panel discussions. Lee and John Romita Sr. launched the Spider-Man newspaper comic strip on January 3, 1977. [107] Lee\\'s final collaboration with Jack Kirby, The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience , was published in 1978 as part of the Marvel Fireside Books series and is considered to be Marvel\\'s first graphic novel . [108] Lee and John Buscema produced the first issue of The Savage She-Hulk (February 1980), which introduced the female cousin of the Hulk, [109] and crafted a Silver Surfer story for Epic Illustrated #1 (Spring 1980). [110]  He moved to California in 1981 to develop Marvel\\'s TV and movie properties. He was an executive producer for, and made cameo appearances in Marvel film adaptations and other movies. He occasionally returned to comic book writing with various Silver Surfer projects including a 1982 one-shot drawn by John Byrne , [111] the Judgment Day graphic novel illustrated by John Buscema, [112] the Parable limited series drawn by French artist Mœbius , [113] and The Enslavers graphic novel with Keith Pollard . [114] Lee was briefly president of the entire company, but soon stepped down to become publisher instead, finding that being president was too much about numbers and finance and not enough about the creative process he enjoyed. [115]   Beyond Marvel [ edit ]  Lee stepped away from regular duties at Marvel in the 1990s, though he continued to receive an annual salary of $1\\xa0million as chairman emeritus. [116] In 1998 he and Peter Paul began a new Internet-based superhero creation, production, and marketing studio, Stan Lee Media . [117] It grew to 165 people and went public through a reverse merger structured by investment banker Stan Medley in 1999, but, near the end of 2000, investigators discovered illegal stock manipulation by Paul and corporate officer Stephan Gordon. [118] Stan Lee Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2001. [119] Paul was extradited to the U.S. from Brazil and pleaded guilty to violating SEC Rule 10b-5 in connection with trading his stock in Stan Lee Media. [120] [121] Lee was never implicated in the scheme. [ citation needed ]  Following the success of Fox Studio\\'s 2000 X-Men film and Sony\\'s then-current Spider-Man film, Lee sued Marvel in 2002, claiming that the company was failing to pay his share of the profits from movies featuring the characters he had co-created. Because he had done so as an employee, Lee did not own them, but in the 1990s, after decades of making little money licensing them for television and film, Marvel had promised him 10% of any future profits. [116] Lee and the company settled in 2005 for an undisclosed seven-figure amount. [122] [116]  In 2001, Lee, Gill Champion, and Arthur Lieberman formed POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment to develop film, television, and video game properties. Lee created the risqué animated superhero series Stripperella for Spike TV . That same year, DC Comics released its first work written by Lee, the Just Imagine... series, in which Lee reimagined the DC superheroes Superman , Batman , Wonder Woman , Green Lantern , and the Flash . [123]  In 2004, POW! Entertainment went public through a reverse merger again structured by investment banker Stan Medley. Also that year, Lee announced a superhero program that would feature former Beatle Ringo Starr as the lead character. [124] [125] Additionally, in August of that year, Lee announced the launch of Stan Lee\\'s Sunday Comics, [126] a short-lived subscription service hosted by Komikwerks .com. From July 2006 until September 2007 Lee hosted, co-created, executive-produced, and judged the reality television  game show competition Who Wants to Be a Superhero? on the Sci-Fi Channel . [127]  In March 2007, after Stan Lee Media had been purchased by Jim Nesfield, the company filed a lawsuit against Marvel Entertainment for $5\\xa0billion, claiming Lee had given his rights to several Marvel characters to Stan Lee Media in exchange for stock and a salary. [128] In June 2007, Stan Lee Media sued Lee; his newer company, POW! Entertainment; and POW! subsidiary QED Entertainment. [129] [130]  In 2008, Lee wrote humorous captions for the political fumetti book Stan Lee Presents Election Daze: What Are They Really Saying? [131] In April of that year, Brighton Partners and Rainmaker Animation announced a partnership with POW! to produce a CGI film series, Legion of 5 . [132] Other projects by Lee announced in the late 2000s included a line of superhero comics for Virgin Comics , [133] a TV adaptation of the novel Hero , [134] a foreword to Skyscraperman by skyscraper fire-safety advocate and Spider-Man fan Dan Goodwin , [135] a partnership with Guardian Media Entertainment and The Guardian Project to create NHL superhero mascots, [136] and work with the Eagle Initiative program to find new talent in the comic book field. [137]    Lee promoting Stan Lee\\'s Kids Universe at the 2011 New York Comic Con  In October 2011, Lee announced he would partner with 1821 Comics on a multimedia imprint for children, Stan Lee\\'s Kids Universe, a move he said addressed the lack of comic books targeted for that demographic; and that he was collaborating with the company on its futuristic graphic novel Romeo & Juliet : The War , by writer Max Work and artist Skan Srisuwan. [138] [139] At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Lee announced his YouTube channel, Stan Lee\\'s World of Heroes , which airs programs created by Lee, Mark Hamill , Peter David , Adrianne Curry and Bonnie Burton , among others. [140] [141] [142] [143] Lee wrote the book Zodiac , released in January 2015, with Stuart Moore . [144] The film Stan Lee\\'s Annihilator , based on a Chinese prisoner-turned-superhero named Ming and in production since 2013, was released in 2015. [145] [146] [147]  In 2008 POW! Entertainment debuted the manga series Karakuri Dôji Ultimo , a collaboration between Lee and Hiroyuki Takei , Viz Media and Shueisha , [148] The following year POW! released Heroman , which was written by Lee, and serialized in Square Enix \\'s Monthly Shōnen Gangan with the Japanese company Bones . [149] [150] In 2011, Lee started writing a live-action musical, The Yin and Yang Battle of Tao, [151] and created the limited series Blood Red Dragon , a collaboration with Todd McFarlane and Japanese rock star Yoshiki . [152] [153]  The 2000s saw Lee\\'s public persona penetrate the public consciousness through merchandising, branding, and appearances in Marvel books as a character in the Marvel Universe . In 2006, Marvel commemorated Lee\\'s 65 years with the company by publishing a series of one-shot comics starring Lee himself meeting and interacting with many of his co-creations, including Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, the Thing , Silver Surfer , and Doctor Doom . These comics also featured short pieces by such comics creators as Joss Whedon and Fred Hembeck , as well as reprints of classic Lee-written adventures. [154] At the 2007 Comic-Con International , Marvel Legends introduced a Stan Lee action figure . The body beneath the figure\\'s removable cloth wardrobe is a reused mold of a previously released Spider-Man action figure, with minor changes. [155]  Comikaze Expo , Los Angeles\\' largest comic book convention, was rebranded as Stan Lee\\'s Comikaze Presented by POW! Entertainment in 2012. [156]  At the 2016 Comic-Con International , Lee introduced his digital graphic novel Stan Lee\\'s God Woke , [157] [158] [159] with text originally written as a poem he presented at Carnegie Hall in 1972. [160] The print-book version won the 2017 Independent Publisher Book Awards \\' Outstanding Books of the Year Independent Voice Award. [161]  On July 6, 2020, Genius Brands acquired exclusive worldwide rights to use Lee\\'s name, physical likeness, and signature as well as licensing rights to his name and original IPs from POW! Entertainment . The assets will be placed under a new joint-venture with POW!, called Stan Lee Universe. [162]   Legal concerns [ edit ]  Lee engaged in several legal actions in his later years.  Intellectual property [ edit ]  In 2017, POW! was acquired by Camsing International, a Chinese company, during the period Lee was caring for his terminally-ill wife and dealing with his own failing eyesight. Lee filed a US$1 billion lawsuit against POW! in May 2018, asserting that POW! had not disclosed the terms of its acquisition by Camsing to him. Lee stated that POW! CEO Shane Duffy and co-founder Gill Champion had presented him with what they said was a non-exclusive license for POW! for him to sign, under Camsing, to use his likeness and other intellectual property; however, this contract turned out to be an exclusive license, which Lee claimed he would never have entered. Additionally, Lee\\'s lawsuit contended that POW! took over his social media accounts and was impersonating him inappropriately. POW! considered these complaints without merit, and claimed that both Lee and his daughter J.C. were aware of the terms. [163] The lawsuit was dropped in July 2018, with Lee issuing a statement that \"The whole thing has been confusing to everyone, including myself and the fans, but I am now happy to be surrounded by those who want the best for me\", and that he was happy to be working with POW! again. [164]  However, following Lee\\'s death, his daughter J.C. gathered a legal team to review the legal situation relating to Lee\\'s intellectual property from his later years. In September 2019, J.C. filed a new lawsuit against POW! in the United States District Court for the Central District of California related not only to recent events, but to regain the intellectual property rights that Lee had set up when founding Stan Lee Entertainment in 1998. The complaint identified a period between 2001 and 2017 during which Lee\\'s partners Gill Champion and Arthur Lieberman were said to have misled Lee about various intellectual property rights deals. [165]  In June 2020, Judge Otis D. Wright II dismissed J.C. Lee\\'s lawsuit against POW! Entertainment, declaring it \"frivolous\" and \"improper\", sanctioning J.C. Lee for $1,000,000, and sanctioning her lawyers for $250,000 individually and severally . The court also gave POW! Entertainment the right to make a motion to recover legal fees. \"We feel vindicated by the Court\\'s decision today,\" said POW! in a statement. \"Stan purposefully created POW! eighteen years ago with me as a place to safeguard his life\\'s work. Before he passed, Stan was adamant that POW! continue to protect his creations and his identity after he was gone, because he trusted that we would safeguard his legacy for generations to come.\" [166]   Victim of elder abuse [ edit ]  In April 2018, The Hollywood Reporter published a report that claimed Lee was a victim of elder abuse ; the report asserted that among others, Keya Morgan, Lee\\'s business manager and a memorabilia collector, had been isolating Lee from his trusted friends and associates following his wife\\'s death, to obtain access to Lee\\'s wealth, estimated to amount to US$50 million . [167] [168] In August 2018, Morgan was issued a restraining order to stay away from Lee, his daughter, and his associates for three years. [169] The Los Angeles Superior Court charged Morgan in May 2019 with five counts of abuse for events that had occurred in mid-2018. [170] The charges were false imprisonment , grand theft of an elder or dependent adult, fraud , forgery , and elder abuse. [171] [172]  Another figure in the alleged abuse was Lee\\'s former business manager Jerardo Olivarez, who was introduced to Lee by J.C. after his wife\\'s death. Lee filed suit against Olivarez in April 2018, calling him one of several \"unscrupulous businessmen, sycophants and opportunists\" that approached him during this period. According to Lee\\'s complaint, after gaining Lee\\'s power of attorney, Olivarez fired Lee\\'s personal banker, changed Lee\\'s will, convinced him to allow transfers of millions of dollars from his accounts and used some of the funds to purchase a condominium.

[175]  Boston \\'s Mayor Marty Walsh named August 2, 2015 as \"Stan Lee Day\" for the city during the annual Boston Comic-Con event.

Stan Lee is featured prominently as a story character in Margie #36 (June 1947). He later appears in a mask on the cover of Black Rider #8 (March 1950), albeit as a character model, not as Stan Lee.   Lee and Kirby (bottom left) as themselves on the cover of The Fantastic Four #10 (January 1963). Art by Kirby and Dick Ayers .  Lee and Jack Kirby appear as themselves in The Fantastic Four #10 (January 1963), the first of several appearances within the fictional Marvel Universe . [190] The two are depicted as similar to their real-world counterparts, creating comic books based on the \"real\" adventures of the Fantastic Four. Kirby later portrayed himself, Lee, production executive Sol Brodsky , and Lee\\'s secretary Flo Steinberg as superheroes in What If #11 (October 1978), \"What If the Marvel Bullpen Had Become the Fantastic Four?\", in which Lee played the role of Mister Fantastic . Lee was shown in numerous cameo appearances in many Marvel titles, appearing in audiences and crowds at many characters\\' ceremonies and parties. For example, he is seen hosting an old-soldiers reunion in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #100 (July 1972), in The Amazing Spider-Man #169 (June 1977), as a bar patron in Marvels #3 (1994), [191] at Karen Page \\'s funeral in Daredevil vol. 2, #8 (June 1998), and as the priest officiating at Luke Cage and Jessica Jones \\' wedding in New Avengers Annual #1 (June 2006). Lee and Kirby appear as professors in Marvel Adventures Spider-Man #19 (2006). He appears in Generation X #17 (July 1996) as a circus ringmaster narrating (in lines written by Lee) a story set in an abandoned circus. This characterization was revived in Marvel\\'s \"Flashback\" series of titles cover-dated July 1997, numbered \"-1\", introducing stories about Marvel characters before they became superheroes. In Stan Lee Meets Superheroes (2007), written by Lee, he comes into contact with some of his favorite creations. [154]    DC Comics [ edit ]  In the first series of Angel and the Ape , (1968-69), Lee was parodied as Stan Bragg, editor of Brain-Pix Comics. Lee was parodied by Kirby in Mister Miracle in the early 1970s, as Funky Flashman . [192]    Other publishers [ edit ]  Lee and other comics creators are mentioned in Michael Chabon \\'s 2000 novel set in the early comics industry The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay . Under the name Stanley Lieber , he appears briefly in Paul Malmont \\'s 2006 novel The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril . [193]  In Lavie Tidhar \\'s 2013 The Violent Century , Lee appears – as Stanley Martin Lieber – as a historian of superhumans. [194]   Film and television appearances [ edit ]  Further information: List of cameo appearances by Stan Lee  Lee had cameo appearances in many Marvel film and television projects, including those within the Marvel Cinematic Universe . [195] A few of these appearances are self-aware and sometimes reference Lee\\'s involvement in the creation of certain characters.

[197] He additionally voiced a cameo appearance as himself in the 2018 DC Comics movie Teen Titans Go! To the Movies .

He said in lectures and elsewhere that he simply answered a newspaper ad seeking a publishing assistant, not knowing it involved comics, let alone his cousin Jean\\'s husband, Martin Goodman: I applied for a job in a publishing company\\xa0... I didn\\'t even know they published comics. I was fresh out of high school, and I wanted to get into the publishing business, if I could. There was an ad in the paper that said, \"Assistant Wanted in a Publishing House.\" When I found out that they wanted me to assist in comics, I figured, \\'Well, I\\'ll stay here for a little while and get some experience, and then I\\'ll get out into the real world.\\' ...\\xa0I just wanted to know, \\'What do you do in a publishing company?\\' How do you write? ... How do you publish? I was an assistant. There were two people there named Joe Simon and Jack Kirby – Joe was sort-of the editor/artist/writer, and Jack was the artist/writer. Joe was the senior member. They were turning out most of the artwork. Then there was the publisher, Martin Goodman\\xa0... And that was about the only staff that I was involved with. After a while, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby left. I was about 17 years old [sic], and Martin Goodman said to me, \\'Do you think you can hold down the job of editor until I can find a real person?\\' When you\\'re 17, what do you know? I said, \\'Sure! I can do it!\\' I think he forgot about me, because I stayed there ever since. [42]  In his 2002 autobiography, Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee , he writes:  My uncle, Robbie Solomon, told me they might be able to use someone at a publishing company where he worked. The idea of being involved in publishing definitely appealed to me. ... So I contacted the man Robbie said did the hiring, Joe Simon, and applied for a job. He took me on and I began working as a gofer for eight dollars a week...  Joe Simon, in his 1990 autobiography The Comic Book Makers , gives the account slightly differently: \"One day [Goodman\\'s relative known as] Uncle Robbie came to work with a lanky 17-year-old in tow. \\'This is Stanley Lieber, Martin\\'s wife\\'s cousin,\\' Uncle Robbie said. \\'Martin wants you to keep him busy.\\'\" In an appendix, however, Simon appears to reconcile the two accounts. He relates a 1989 conversation with Lee:   Lee: I\\'ve been saying this [classified-ad] story for years, but apparently it isn\\'t so. And I can\\'t remember because I[\\'ve] said it so long now that I believe it. ... Simon: Your Uncle Robbie brought you into the office one day and he said, \\'This is Martin Goodman\\'s wife\\'s nephew.\\' [sic] ... You were seventeen years old. Lee: Sixteen and a half!  Simon: Well, Stan, you told me seventeen. You were probably trying to be older... I did hire you.

The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee , developed by scripter Larry Lieber , and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby . The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 ( cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). Also in 1963, the character founded the Avengers alongside Thor , Ant-Man , Wasp and the Hulk . A wealthy American business magnate , playboy , philanthropist , inventor and ingenious scientist , Anthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction , he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries . He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man. Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology and industry in the fight against communism . Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the time. [1]  Throughout most of the character\\'s publication history, Iron Man has been a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book series. Iron Man has been adapted for several animated TV shows and films.  In the Marvel Cinematic Universe , the character was portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. , appearing in the films Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008) in a cameo, Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). The character also appeared in Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) and in the upcoming Black Widow (2021) through archive footage. Iron Man was ranked 12th on IGN \\'s \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\" in 2011 [2] and third in their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\" in 2012.

[4] In 1963, Lee had been toying with the idea of a businessman superhero. [5] He wanted to create the \"quintessential capitalist\", a character that would go against the spirit of the times and Marvel\\'s readership. [6] Lee said,  .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} I think I gave myself a dare. It was the height of the Cold War . The readers, the young readers, if there was one thing they hated, it was war, it was the military ... So I got a hero who represented that to the hundredth degree. He was a weapons manufacturer, he was providing weapons for the Army, he was rich, he was an industrialist ... I thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of our readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make them like him ... And he became very popular. [7]  He set out to make the new character a wealthy, glamorous ladies\\' man, but one with a secret that would plague and torment him as well. [8] Writer Gerry Conway said, \"Here you have this character, who on the outside is invulnerable, I mean, just can\\'t be touched, but inside is a wounded figure. Stan made it very much an in-your-face wound, you know, his heart was broken, you know, literally broken. But there\\'s a metaphor going on there. And that\\'s, I think, what made that character interesting.\" [7] Lee based this playboy\\'s looks and personality on Howard Hughes , [9] explaining, \"Howard Hughes was one of the most colorful men of our time. He was an inventor, an adventurer, a multi-billionaire, a ladies\\' man and finally a nutcase.\" [10] \"Without being crazy, he was Howard Hughes,\" Lee said. [7]  While Lee intended to write the story himself, [11] a minor deadline emergency eventually forced him to hand over the premiere issue to Lieber, who fleshed out the story. [8] The art was split between Kirby and Heck. \"He designed the costume,\" Heck said of Kirby, \"because he was doing the cover. The covers were always done first. But I created the look of the characters, like Tony Stark and his secretary Pepper Potts .\" [12] In a 1990 interview, when asked if he had \"a specific model for Tony Stark and the other characters?\", Heck replied \"No, I would be thinking more along the lines of some characters I like, which would be the same kind of characters that Alex Toth liked, which was an Errol Flynn type.\" [13] Iron Man first appeared in 13- to 18-page stories in Tales of Suspense, which featured anthology  science fiction and supernatural stories. The character\\'s original costume was a bulky gray armored suit, replaced by a golden version in the second story (issue #40, April 1963). It was redesigned as sleeker, red-and-golden armor in issue #48 (Dec. 1963) by that issue\\'s interior artist, Steve Ditko , although Kirby drew it on the cover. As Heck recalled in 1985, \"[T]he second costume, the red and yellow one, was designed by Steve Ditko. I found it easier than drawing that bulky old thing. The earlier design, the robot-looking one, was more Kirbyish.\" [14]  In his premiere, Iron Man was an anti-communist hero, defeating various Vietnamese agents. Lee later regretted this early focus. [5] [15] Throughout the character\\'s comic book series, technological advancement and national defense were constant themes for Iron Man, but later issues developed Stark into a more complex and vulnerable character as they depicted his battle with alcoholism (as in the \" Demon in a Bottle \" storyline) and other personal difficulties. From issue #59 (Nov. 1964) to its final issue #99 (March 1968), the anthological science-fiction backup stories in Tales of Suspense were replaced by a feature starring the superhero Captain America . Lee and Heck introduced several adversaries for the character including the Mandarin in issue #50 (Feb. 1964), [16] the Black Widow in #52 (April 1964) [17] and Hawkeye five issues later. [18]  Lee said that \"of all the comic books we published at Marvel, we got more fan mail for Iron Man from women, from females, than any other title ... We didn\\'t get much fan mail from girls, but whenever we did, the letter was usually addressed to Iron Man.\" [7]  Lee and Kirby included Iron Man in The Avengers #1 (Sept. 1963) as a founding member of the superhero team. The character has since appeared in every subsequent volume of the series. Writers have updated the war and locale in which Stark is injured. In the original 1963 story, it was the Vietnam War . In the 1990s, it was updated to be the first Gulf War , [19] and in the 2000s updated again to be the war in Afghanistan . Stark\\'s time with the Asian Nobel Prize -winning scientist Ho Yinsen is consistent through nearly all incarnations of the Iron Man origin, depicting Stark and Yinsen building the original armor together. One exception is the direct-to-DVD animated feature film The Invincible Iron Man , in which the armor Stark uses to escape his captors is not the first Iron Man suit.  Themes [ edit ]  The original Iron Man title explored Cold War themes, as did other Stan Lee projects in the early years of Marvel Comics . Where The Fantastic Four and The Incredible Hulk respectively focused on American domestic and government responses to the Communist threat, Iron Man explored industry\\'s role in the struggle. Tony Stark\\'s real-life model, Howard Hughes , was a significant defense contractor who developed new weapons technologies. Hughes was an icon both of American individualism and of the burdens of fame. [20]  Historian Robert Genter, in The Journal of Popular Culture , writes that Tony Stark specifically presents an idealized portrait of the American inventor. Where earlier decades had seen important technological innovations come from famous individuals (e.g., Nikola Tesla , Thomas Edison , Alexander Graham Bell , the Wright brothers ), the 1960s saw new technologies (including weapons) being developed mainly by the research teams of corporations . As a result, little room remained for the inventor who wanted credit for, and creative and economic control over, their own creations. Issues of entrepreneurial autonomy, government supervision of research, and ultimate loyalty figured prominently in early Iron Man stories—the same issues affecting American scientists and engineers of that era. [20] Tony Stark, writes Genter, is an inventor who finds motive in his emasculation as an autonomous creative individual. This blow is symbolized by his chest wound, inflicted at the moment he is forced to invent things for the purposes of others, instead of just himself. To Genter, Stark\\'s transformation into Iron Man represents Stark\\'s effort to reclaim his autonomy, and thus his manhood. The character\\'s pursuit of women in bed or in battle, writes Genter, represents another aspect of this effort. The pattern finds parallels in other works of 1960s popular fiction by authors such as \" Ian Fleming (creator of James Bond ), Mickey Spillane ( Mike Hammer ), and Norman Mailer , who made unregulated sexuality a form of authenticity.\" [20]   Solo series [ edit ]  After issue #99 (March 1968), the Tales of Suspense series was renamed Captain America . An Iron Man story appeared in the one-shot comic Iron Man and Sub-Mariner (April 1968), before the \"Golden Avenger\" [21] made his solo debut with Iron Man #1 (May 1968). [22] The series\\' indicia gives its copyright title Iron Man, while the trademarked cover logo of most issues is The Invincible Iron Man.  This initial series ended with issue #332 (Sept. 1996). Jim Lee , Scott Lobdell , and Jeph Loeb authored a second volume of the series which was drawn primarily by Whilce Portacio and Ryan Benjamin . This volume took place in a parallel universe [23] and ran 13 issues (Nov. 1996 – Nov. 1997). [24] Volume 3, whose first 25 issues were written by Kurt Busiek [25] and then by Busiek and Roger Stern , ran 89 issues (Feb. 1998 – Dec. 2004). Later writers included Joe Quesada , Frank Tieri , Mike Grell , and John Jackson Miller . Issue #41 (June 2001) was additionally numbered #386, reflecting the start of dual numbering starting from the premiere issue of volume one in 1968. The final issue was dual-numbered as #434. [26] The next Iron Man series, Iron Man vol. 4, debuted in early 2005 with the Warren Ellis -written storyline \" Extremis \", with artist Adi Granov . [27] [28] It ran 35 issues (Jan. 2005 – Jan. 2009), with the cover logo simply Iron Man beginning with issue #13, and Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. , beginning issue #15. On the final three issues, the cover logo was overwritten by \"War Machine, Weapon of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", [29] which led to the launch of a War Machine ongoing series. [30]  The Invincible Iron Man vol. 1, by writer Matt Fraction and artist Salvador Larroca , began with a premiere issue cover-dated July 2008. [31] For a seven-month overlap, Marvel published both volume four and volume five simultaneously. [32] This Invincible volume jumped its numbering of issues from #33 to #500, cover dated March 2011, to reflect the start from the premiere issue of volume one in 1968. After the conclusion of The Invincible Iron Man a new Iron Man series was started as a part of Marvel Now! . Written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Greg Land , it began with issue #1 in November 2012. [33]  Many Iron Man annuals , miniseries , and one-shot titles have been published through the years, such as Age of Innocence: The Rebirth of Iron Man (Feb. 1996), Iron Man: The Iron Age #1–2 (Aug.–Sept. 1998), Iron Man: Bad Blood #1–4 (Sept.–Dec. 2000), Iron Man House of M #1–3 (Sept.–Nov. 2005), Fantastic Four / Iron Man: Big in Japan #1–4 (Dec. 2005–March 2006), Iron Man: The Inevitable #1–6 (Feb.–July 2006), Iron Man / Captain America: Casualties of War (Feb. 2007), Iron Man: Hypervelocity #1–6 (March–Aug. 2007), Iron Man: Enter the Mandarin #1–6 (Nov. 2007–April 2008), and Iron Man: Legacy of Doom (June–Sept. 2008). Publications have included such spin-offs as the one-shot Iron Man 2020 (June 1994), featuring a different Iron Man in the future, and the animated TV series adaptations Marvel Action Hour, Featuring Iron Man #1–8 (Nov. 1994–June 1995) and Marvel Adventures Iron Man #1–12 (July 2007–June 2008).

Cover art by Jack Kirby and Don Heck . Tales of Suspense #48 (Dec. 1963), the debut of Iron Man\\'s first red-and-gold suit of armor. Cover art by Jack Kirby and Sol Brodsky .  Origins [ edit ]  Anthony Edward Stark is the son of wealthy industrialist and head of Stark Industries , Howard Stark , and Maria Stark . A boy genius, he enters MIT at the age of 15 to study engineering and later receives master\\'s degrees in engineering and physics. After his parents are killed in a car accident, he inherits his father\\'s company. Stark is injured by a booby trap and captured by enemy forces led by Wong-Chu . Wong-Chu orders Stark to build weapons, but Stark\\'s injuries are dire and shrapnel is moving towards his heart. His fellow prisoner, Ho Yinsen , a Nobel Prize -winning physicist whose work Stark had greatly admired during college, constructs a magnetic chest plate to keep the shrapnel from reaching Stark\\'s heart. In secret, Stark and Yinsen use the workshop to design and construct a suit of powered armor , which Stark uses to escape. During the escape attempt, Yinsen sacrifices his life to save Stark\\'s by distracting the enemy as Stark recharges. Stark takes revenge on his kidnappers and rejoins the American forces, on his way meeting a wounded American Marine fighter pilot, James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes . Back home, Stark discovers that the shrapnel fragment lodged in his chest cannot be removed without killing him, and he is forced to wear the armor\\'s chestplate beneath his clothes to act as a regulator for his heart. He must recharge the chestplate every day or else risk the shrapnel killing him. The cover story that Stark tells the news media and general public is that Iron Man is his robotic personal bodyguard , and corporate mascot. To that end, Iron Man fights threats to his company (e.g., Communist opponents Black Widow , the Crimson Dynamo , and the Titanium Man ), as well as independent villains like the Mandarin (who becomes his greatest enemy). No one suspects Stark of being Iron Man, as he cultivates a strong public image of being a rich playboy and industrialist. Two notable members of the series\\' supporting cast, at this point, are his personal chauffeur Harold \"Happy\" Hogan , and secretary Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts —to both of whom he eventually reveals his dual identity. Meanwhile, James Rhodes finds his own niche as Stark\\'s personal pilot, ultimately revealing himself to be a man of extraordinary skill and daring in his own right. The series took an anti-Communist stance in its early years, which was softened as public (and therefore, presumably, reader) opposition rose to the Vietnam War . [5] This change evolved in a series of storylines featuring Stark reconsidering his political opinions, and the morality of manufacturing weapons for the U.S. military. Stark shows himself to be occasionally arrogant, and willing to act unethically in order to \\'let the ends justify the means\\'. [35] [36] This leads to personal conflicts with the people around him, both in his civilian and superhero identities. Stark uses his vast personal fortune not only to outfit his own armor, but also to develop weapons for S.H.I.E.L.D. ; other technologies (e.g., Quinjets used by the Avengers ); and the image inducers used by the X-Men . Eventually, Stark\\'s heart condition is publicly discovered when he was summoned for a Congressional hearing and Stark collapsed when his chestpiece\\'s power failed, causing a heart attack. Stark was medically examined, which revealed his hidden equipment, and was hospitalized, forcing Pepper to have Happy don his employer\\'s armor to pose as Iron Man protect his boss\\' secret identity. [37] Eventually, that specific medical issue was resolved with an artificial heart transplant , which still required the chestplate for some time to support the replacement organ. [38]   1970s and early 1980s [ edit ]  Stark expands on his armor designs and begins to build his arsenal of specialized armors for particular situations such as for space travel [39] and stealth . [40] [41] Stark also develops a serious dependency on alcohol in the \" Demon in a Bottle \" storyline. [42] The first time it becomes a problem is when Stark discovers that the national security agency S.H.I.E.L.D. has been buying a controlling interest in his company in order to ensure Stark\\'s continued weapons development for them. At the same time, it is revealed that several minor supervillains armed with advanced weapons who had bedeviled Stark throughout his superhero career are in fact in the employ of Stark\\'s business rival, Justin Hammer , who begins to plague Stark more directly. [43] [44] At one point in Hammer\\'s manipulations, the Iron Man armor is taken over and used to murder a diplomat. [44] Although Iron Man is not immediately under suspicion, Stark is forced to hand the armor over to the authorities. [45] Eventually Stark and Rhodes, who is now his personal pilot and confidant, track down and defeat those responsible, although Hammer would return to bedevil Stark again. [39] [46] With the support of his then-girlfriend, Bethany Cabe , his friends and his employees, Stark pulls through these crises and overcomes his dependency on alcohol. [47] Even as he recovers from this harrowing personal trial, Stark\\'s life is further complicated when he has a confrontation with Doctor Doom that is interrupted by an opportunistic enemy sending them back in time to the time of King Arthur . [48] Once there, Iron Man thwarts Doom\\'s attempt to solicit the aid of Morgan Le Fay , and the Latverian ruler swears deadly vengeance—to be indulged sometime after the two return to their own time. [49] This incident was collected and published as Doomquest .  Some time later, a ruthless rival, Obadiah Stane , manipulates Stark emotionally into a serious relapse. As a result, Stark loses control of Stark International to Stane, becomes a homeless alcoholic vagrant and gives up his armored identity to Rhodes, who becomes the new Iron Man. Eventually, Stark recovers and joins a new startup, Circuits Maximus. Stark concentrates on new technological designs, including building a new set of armor as part of his recuperative therapy. Rhodes continues to act as Iron Man but steadily grows more aggressive and paranoid, due to the armor not having been calibrated properly for his use. Eventually Rhodes goes on a rampage, and Stark has to don a replica of his original armor to stop him. Fully recovered, Stark confronts Stane who has himself designed armor based on designs seized along with Stark International, dubbing himself the \\'Iron Monger\\'. Defeated in battle, Stane, rather than give Stark the satisfaction of taking him to trial, commits suicide. [50] Shortly thereafter, Stark regains his personal fortune, but decides against repurchasing Stark International until much later; he instead creates Stark Enterprises, headquartered in Los Angeles .  Late 1980s and 1990s [ edit ]  In an attempt to stop other people from misusing his designs, Stark goes about disabling other armored heroes and villains who are using suits based on the Iron Man technology, the designs of which were stolen by his enemy Spymaster . His quest to destroy the stolen technology—originally called \"Stark Wars\" but is more commonly known as the \" Armor Wars \"—severely hurts his reputation as Iron Man. After attacking and disabling a series of minor villains such as Stilt-Man , he attacks and defeats the government operative known as Stingray . The situation worsens when Stark realizes that Stingray\\'s armor does not incorporate any of his designs. He publicly \"fires\" Iron Man while covertly pursuing his agenda. He uses the cover story of wanting to help disable the rogue Iron Man to infiltrate and disable the armor of the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives known as the Mandroids , as well as the armor of the Guardsmen . In the process, Iron Man and Jim Rhodes allow some of the villains in the Vault to escape. This leads the United States government to declare Iron Man a danger and an outlaw, and severely sours Stark\\'s relationship with Steve Rogers ( Captain America , who was in his \"Captain\" persona at the time). Iron Man travels to Russia where he inadvertently causes the death of the Soviet Titanium Man during a fight. Returning to the U.S., he faces an enemy commissioned by the government named Firepower . Unable to defeat him head on, Stark fakes Iron Man\\'s demise, [51] intending to retire the suit permanently. When Firepower goes rogue, Stark creates a new suit, claiming a new person is in the armor. Soon after, Stark is nearly killed by Kathy Dare, a mentally unbalanced former lover. She shoots him dead center in his torso which injures his spine, paralyzing him. [52] Stark undergoes special surgery to have a nerve chip implanted into his spine to regain his mobility. [53] Unbeknownst to the industrialist, the nerve chip is a clandestine means by which to gain control over his body. Rival businessmen the Marrs Twins and their cohort Kearson DeWitt are behind the machinations in what came to be known as \"Armor Wars II.\" [54] After several successful tests by DeWitt at manipulating Stark, Tony finds that using his Encephalo Armor can counteract DeWitt\\'s controls. [55] In response, DeWitt suddenly releases his control resulting in excruciating agony throughout Stark\\'s body. [56] The constant \"battle\" for control of Stark\\'s nervous system and subsequent abdication on DeWitt\\'s end lead to massive nerve damage throughout Tony\\'s body. Stark\\'s nervous system continues its slide towards failure, and he constructs a \"skin\" made up of artificial nerve circuitry to assist it. [57] Stark begins to pilot a remote-controlled Iron Man armor, but when faced with the Masters of Silence, the telepresence suit proves inadequate. [58] Stark designs a more heavily armed version of the suit to wear, the \"Variable Threat Response Battle Suit\", which becomes known as the War Machine armor . Ultimately, the damage to his nervous system becomes too extensive. Faking his death, Stark places himself in suspended animation to heal as Rhodes takes over both the running of Stark Enterprises and the mantle of Iron Man, although he uses the War Machine armor. [59] Stark eventually makes a full recovery by using a chip to create an entirely new (artificial) nervous system, and resumes as Iron Man in a new Telepresence Armor . [60] When Rhodes learns that Stark has manipulated his friends by faking his own death, he becomes enraged and the two friends part ways. Rhodes continues on as War Machine in a solo career. The Avengers story arc \"The Crossing\" reveals Iron Man as a traitor among the team\\'s ranks, due to years of manipulation by the time-traveling dictator Kang the Conqueror . Stark, as a sleeper agent in Kang\\'s thrall, kills Marilla, the nanny of Crystal and Quicksilver\\'s daughter Luna, as well as Rita DeMara, the female Yellowjacket , then Amanda Chaney, an ally of the Avengers. The \" Avengers Forever \" limited series retcons these events as the work of a disguised Immortus , not Kang, and that the mental control had gone back only a few months. [61]  Needing help to defeat both Stark and Kang, the team travels back in time to recruit a teenaged Anthony Stark from an alternate timeline to assist them. The young Stark steals an Iron Man suit in order to aid the Avengers against his older self. The sight of his younger self shocks the older Stark enough for him to regain momentary control of his actions, and he sacrifices his life to stop Kang. [62] The young Stark later builds his own suit to become the new Iron Man and remains in the present day. During the battle with the creature called Onslaught , the teenage Stark dies, along with many other superheroes. Franklin Richards preserves these \"dead\" heroes in the \" Heroes Reborn \" pocket universe, in which Stark is once again an adult hero; Franklin recreates the heroes in the pocket universe in the forms he is most familiar with rather than what they are at the present. The reborn adult Stark, upon returning to the normal Marvel Universe, merges with the original Stark, who had died during \"The Crossing\", but was resurrected by Franklin Richards. This new Anthony Stark possesses the memories of both the original and teenage Anthony Stark, and thus considers himself to be essentially both of them. With the aid of the law firm Nelson & Murdock , he regains his fortune and, with Stark Enterprises having been sold to the Fujikawa Corporation following Stark\\'s death, sets up a new company, Stark Solutions. He returns from the pocket universe with a restored and healthy heart. After the Avengers reform, Stark demands a hearing be convened to look into his actions just prior to the Onslaught incident. Cleared of wrongdoing, he rejoins the Avengers. [63]   2000s [ edit ]  At one point, Stark\\'s armor becomes sentient despite fail-safes to prevent its increasingly sophisticated computer systems from doing so. [64] Initially, Stark welcomes this \"living\" armor for its improved tactical abilities. The armor begins to grow more aggressive, killing indiscriminately and eventually desiring to replace Stark altogether. In the final confrontation on a desert island, Stark suffers another heart attack. The armor sacrifices its own existence to save its creator\\'s life, giving up essential components to give Stark a new, artificial heart. This new heart solves Stark\\'s health problems, but it does not have an internal power supply, so Stark becomes once again dependent on periodic recharging. The sentient armor incident so disturbs Stark that he temporarily returns to using an unsophisticated early model version of his armor to avoid a repeat incident. [65] He dabbles with using liquid metal circuitry known as S.K.I.N. that forms into a protective shell around his body, but eventually returns to more conventional hard metal armors. [66]  During this time, Stark engages in a romance with Rumiko Fujikawa , [67] a wealthy heiress and daughter of the man who had taken over his company during the \"Heroes Reborn\" period. Her relationship with Stark endures many highs and lows, including infidelity with Stark\\'s rival, Tiberius Stone, in part because the fun-loving Rumiko believes that Stark is too serious and dull. Their relationship ends with Rumiko\\'s death at the hands of an Iron Man impostor in Iron Man (vol. 3) #87. In Iron Man (vol. 3) #55 (July 2002), Stark publicly reveals his dual identity as Iron Man, not realizing that by doing so, he has invalidated the agreements protecting his armor from government duplication, since those contracts state that the Iron Man armor would be used by an employee of Tony Stark, not by Stark himself. When he discovers that the United States military is again using his technology, and its defective nature nearly causes a disaster in Washington, D.C. which Iron Man barely manages to avert, Stark accepts a Presidential appointment as Secretary of Defense . In this way, he hopes to monitor and direct how his designs are used. [68]  In the \" Avengers Disassembled \" storyline, Stark is forced to resign after launching into a tirade against the Latverian ambassador at the United Nations , being manipulated by the mentally imbalanced Scarlet Witch , who destroys Avengers Mansion and kills several members. Stark publicly stands down as Iron Man, but continues using the costume. He joins the Avengers in stopping the breakout in progress from the Raft and even saves Captain America from falling. [69] Tony changes the Avengers base to Stark Tower . [70] The Ghost , the Living Laser and Spymaster reappear and shift Iron Man from standard superhero stories to dealing with politics and industrialism . [71]  New Avengers: Illuminati #1 (June 2006) reveals that years before, Stark had participated with a secret group that included the Black Panther , Professor X , Mister Fantastic , Black Bolt , Doctor Strange , and Namor . The goal of the group (dubbed the Illuminati by Marvel) was to strategize overarching menaces, in which the Black Panther rejects a membership offer. Stark\\'s goal is to create a governing body for all superheroes in the world, but the beliefs of its members instead force them all to share vital information.  \"Civil War\" [ edit ]  In the \" Civil War \" storyline, after the actions of inexperienced superheroes the New Warriors result in the destruction of several city blocks in Stamford, Connecticut, there is an outcry across America against superhumans. Learning of the Government\\'s proposed plans, Tony Stark suggests a new plan to instigate a Superhuman Registration Act . The Act would force every superpowered individual in the U.S. to register their identity with the government and act as licensed agents. The Act would force inexperienced superhumans to receive training in how to use and control their abilities, something in which Tony strongly believes. Since his struggle with alcoholism, Stark has carried a tremendous burden of guilt after nearly killing an innocent bystander while piloting the armor drunk. While Reed Richards and Dr. Henry \"Hank\" Pym both agree with Stark\\'s proposal, not everyone does. After Captain America is ordered to bring in anyone who refuses to register, he and other anti-registration superheroes go rogue, coming into conflict with the pro-registration heroes, led by Iron Man. The war ends when Captain America surrenders to prevent further collateral damage and civilian casualties, although he had defeated Stark by defusing his armor. Stark is appointed the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D., [72] and organizes a new government-sanctioned group of Avengers . Shortly afterwards, Captain America is assassinated while in custody. [73] This leaves Stark with a great amount of guilt and misgivings about the cost of his victory. [74]   \"Secret Invasion\" [ edit ]  To tie into the 2008 Iron Man feature film, Marvel launched a new Iron Man ongoing series, The Invincible Iron Man , with writer Matt Fraction and artist Salvador Larroca . The series inaugural six-part storyline was \"The Five Nightmares\", which saw Stark targeted by Ezekiel Stane , the son of Stark\\'s former nemesis, Obadiah Stane. [75]  In the \" Secret Invasion \" storyline, after Tony Stark survives an attempt by Ultron to take over his body, he is confronted in the hospital by Spider-Woman , holding the corpse of a Skrull posing as Elektra . Realizing this is the start of an invasion by the Skrulls, Tony reveals the corpse to the Illuminati and declares that they are at war. After Black Bolt reveals himself as a Skrull and is killed by Namor , a squadron of Skrulls attack, forcing Tony to evacuate the other Illuminati members and destroy the area, killing all the Skrulls. Realizing that they are incapable of trusting each other, the members all separate to form individual plans for the oncoming invasion. [76]  Stark is discredited and publicly vilified after his inability to anticipate or prevent the secret infiltration and invasion of Earth by the Skrulls, and by the Skrull disabling of his StarkTech technology, which had a virtual monopoly on worldwide defense. [77] After the invasion, the U.S. government removes him as head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and disbands the Avengers , handing control of the Initiative over to Norman Osborn .  \"Dark Reign\" [ edit ]  Main article: Dark Reign (comics)  See also: The Invincible Iron Man  With his Extremis powers failing, Stark uploads a virus to destroy all records of the Registration Act, thus preventing Osborn from learning the identities of his fellow heroes and anything that Osborn could use, including his repulsor generators. The only copy of the database is in Stark\\'s brain, which he tries to delete while on the run from Osborn. [78] Stark goes so far as to inflict brain damage on himself in order to ensure that the relevant information is wiped. When Osborn catches up to the debilitated Stark and beats him savagely, Pepper Potts broadcasts the beatings worldwide, costing Osborn credibility and giving Stark public sympathy. Stark goes into a vegetative state, having previously granted Donald Blake (alter ego of the superhero Thor) power of attorney. [79] A holographic message stored in Pepper\\'s armor reveals that Stark had developed a means of \\'rebooting\\' his mind from his current state prior to his destruction of the database, with Blake and Bucky resolving to use it to restore him to normal. Meanwhile, Stark is trapped in his subconscious, where figments of his own mind prevent him from returning to the waking world. When the procedure fails to work, Bucky calls in Doctor Strange, who succeeds in restoring Stark back to consciousness. The backup Stark created was made prior to the Civil War, and as such he does not remember anything that took place during the event, although he still concludes after reviewing his past actions that he would not have done anything differently. His brain damage means he is now dependent on an arc reactor to sustain his body\\'s autonomous functions. [80]   2010s [ edit ]  \"Siege\" [ edit ]  Main article: Siege (comics)  In the \" Siege \" storyline, Tony Stark is seen under the care of Dr. Donald Blake and Maria Hill when Asgard is attacked. [81]  Thor is ambushed by Osborn and the Sentry , but rescued by Hill. Osborn declares martial law and unleashes Daken and the Sentry on Broxton to root out Thor and Hill. Hill returns to Stark\\'s hiding place to move him to a safer location and are joined by Speed of the Young Avengers , who has a set of Iron Man\\'s MK III armor that Edwin Jarvis had given Captain America.  While Osborn is battling the New Avengers , Stark appears and disables Osborn\\'s Iron Patriot armor. Osborn orders the Sentry to annihilate Asgard, rather than allow the Avengers to have it. After Asgard falls, Stark stands alongside his fellow heroes, as Osborn exclaims they are all doomed and he \\'was saving them from him\\' pointing up towards a Void -possessed Sentry. [82] As the Void tears apart the teams, Loki gives them the power to fight back through the Norn Stones . The Void kills Loki, enraging Thor. Tony tells Thor to get the Void away from Asgard, which allows Tony to drop a commandeered H.A.M.M.E.R. Helicarrier on the Void.  Thor is forced to killed Sentry when the Void resurfaces. Sometime later, the Super-Human Registration Act is repealed and Tony is given back his company and armor. As a symbol for their heroics and their new unity, Thor places an Asgardian tower on Stark Tower where the Watchtower once stood. [83]   \"Heroic Age\" [ edit ]  Main article: Heroic Age (comics)  In the 2010–2011 \"Stark: Resilient\" storyline, Tony builds the Bleeding Edge armor with the help of Mister Fantastic. This new armor fully uses the repulsor tech battery embedded in his chest to power Tony\\'s entire body and mind, thus allowing him access to Extremis once more. Furthermore, the battery operates as his \"heart\" and is the only thing keeping him alive. [84] Tony announces he will form a new company, Stark Resilient. He states that he will no longer develop weapons, but will use his repulsor technology to give free energy to the world. Justine and Sasha Hammer create their own armored hero, Detroit Steel, to take Stark\\'s place as the Army\\'s leading weapons-builder. Stark\\'s plan consists of building two repulsor-powered cars. The Hammers try to foil his efforts. The first car is destroyed by sabotage, while Detroit Steel attacks Stark Resilient\\'s facilities while Tony tests the second car. Through a legal maneuver, Tony is able to get the Hammers to stop their attacks and releases a successful commercial about his new car. [85] [86]   \"Fear Itself\" [ edit ]  In the 2011 \" Fear Itself \" storyline, Earth is attacked by the Serpent , the God of Fear and the long-forgotten brother of Odin. [87] In Paris, Iron Man fights Grey Gargoyle , who has become Mokk, Breaker of Faith, one of the Serpent\\'s Worthy. Mokk leaves Iron Man unconscious and transforms Detroit Steel and the citizens of Paris into stone. [88] [89] To defeat the Serpent\\'s army, Tony drinks a bottle of wine (thus \\'sacrificing\\' his sobriety) to gain an audience with Odin, who allows Tony to enter the realm of Svartalfheim. Tony and the dwarves of Svartalfheim build enchanted weapons. [90] Tony upgrades his armor with uru-infused enchantments and delivers the finished weapons to the Avengers, who use them for the final battle against the Serpent\\'s forces. Iron Man watches as Thor kills the Serpent, but dies in the process. After the battle is over, Tony melts down the weapons he created and repairs Captain America\\'s shield, which had been broken by Serpent, and gives it back to Captain America. [91] During a subsequent argument with Odin about the gods\\' lack of involvement in the recent crisis, Odin gives Tony a brief opportunity to see the vastness of the universe the way he sees it.  As thanks for Tony\\'s role in the recent crisis, Odin restores all the people that the Grey Gargoyle killed during his rampage. [92]   Return of the Mandarin and Marvel NOW! [ edit ]  In the storylines \"Demon\" and \"The Long Way Down\", Stark is subpoenaed by the U.S. government after evidence surfaces of him using the Iron Man armor while under the influence. Mandarin and Zeke Stane upgrade some of Iron Man\\'s old enemies and send them to commit acts of terrorism across the world, intending to discredit Iron Man. General Bruce Babbage forces Stark to wear a tech governor, a device that allows Babbage to deactivate Stark\\'s armor whenever he wants. To fight back, Tony undergoes a surgical procedure that expels the Bleeding Edge technology out of his body and replaces his repulsor node with a new model, forcing Babbage to remove the tech governor off his chest. He announces his retirement as Iron Man, faking Rhodes\\' death and giving him a new armor so that he becomes the new Iron Man. [93] This leads into the next storyline, \"The Future\", in which the Mandarin takes control of Stark\\'s mind and uses him to create new armored bodies for the alien spirits inhabiting his rings, but Stark allies himself with some of his old enemies, who have also been imprisoned by Mandarin, and manages to defeat him. The final issue of this storyline concluded Matt Fraction\\'s series. [94]  In the ongoing series that premiered in 2012 as part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch, Tony Stark has hit a technological ceiling. After the death of Dr. Maya Hansen and the destruction of all of the Extremis Version 2 kits that were being sold to the black market, Tony decides that the Earth is not safe without him learning more from what\\'s in the final frontier. He takes his new suit, enhanced with an artificial intelligence named P.E.P.P.E.R. and joins Peter Quill and The Guardians of the Galaxy after helping them thwart a Badoon attack on Earth. [95]   Superior Iron Man [ edit ]  Tony Stark\\'s personality is inverted during the events of AXIS , bringing out more dark aspects of himself like irresponsibility, egotism and alcoholism. [96] Stark relocates to San Francisco and builds a new, all-white armor.  He supplies the citizens of San Francisco with the Extremis 3.0 app, a version of the techno-virus that offers beauty, health or even immortality, free. [97] When every person in the city viewed Iron Man as a messiah for making their dreams come true, he ended the free trial mode and started charging a daily fee of $99.99, causing many to resort to crime to pay for the upgrade. [98]  Daredevil confronts Stark at his new Alcatraz Island penthouse, but is easily brushed off. [99] Iron Man uses Extremis 3.0 to temporarily restore Daredevil\\'s sight, just to prove his point. [100] Daredevil deduces that Stark had added Extremis to the water supply and the phones only transmit an activation signal, but Stark subjects Murdock to minor brain damage to prevent him from sharing this revelation with others. [101]  After discovering that new villain Teen Abomination is the son of Happy Hogan, Stark decides to help him, [102] but this minor act of redemption is too late for Pepper Potts, who attacks Stark with the aid of an A.I. based on Stark\\'s mind. [103] This culminates in a confrontation between the two Starks, as Stark calls on the unwitting aid of all \\'infected\\' with the Extremis upgrade while the A.I. uses Stark\\'s various old armors to attack him. [104] Although Stark technically wins the battle as he destroys his other armors and deletes the A.I. backup, Pepper states that she plans to reveal the truth about his goals with Extremis, bluntly informing him that if he continues his Extremis upgrade project, he will have to do it alone, accepting his fate of being regarded as a monster by all who know him. [105]   Time Runs Out [ edit ]  During the \"Time Runs Out\" storyline, an attempt at reclaiming Wakanda from the Cabal that Namor had created to destroy incursive Earths results in Tony being held captive in the Necropolis. [106] After the Cabal are apparently killed, the Illuminati free Tony, who is forced to flee due to the Illuminati\\'s unwillingness to let Stark be there with them when they meet Rogers and the Avengers. When the Shi\\'ar and their allies arrive to destroy Earth, the Avengers and the Illuminati unsuccessfully try to retaliate. Iron Man uses Sol\\'s Hammer to destroy the fleet. [107] The incursions continue, and Rogers confronts Stark about what he knows. A fight ensues between them and Stark admits that he had lied and had known about the incursions all along. During the final incursion, Earth-1610\\'s S.H.I.E.L.D. launches a full-scale attack on Earth-616, during which Stark and Rogers are crushed by a Helicarrier. [108]   All-New, All-Different Marvel [ edit ]  After the events of the Secret Wars crossover, Stark returns to his normal self with no signs of his inverted personality. Eight months following the return of the universe as seen in the \" All-New, All-Different Marvel \" event, Tony works in his laboratory non-stop after his position as an innovator had been put in doubt. Because an M.I.T. student reverse-engineered some of his technology, Stark develops a new armor which can change shape according to the situation he would find himself. When Stark\\'s new A.I. F.R.I.D.A.Y. informs him that Madame Masque has broken into the ruins of Castle Doom, he travels to Latveria to investigate and runs into some revolutionaries who are then defeated by a man in a suit. To his amazement, Iron Man\\'s armor computer identifies him as Doctor Doom with his face restored. Doctor Doom claims that he wanted to help Iron Man. [109]  After learning from Doctor Doom that Madame Masque has taken a decoy of the Wand of Watoomb, Tony Stark confronts Madame Masque. Upon learning that Madame Masque is not allied with Doctor Doom, Tony is attacked by her with a burst of energy that damages his armor. [110] F.R.I.D.A.Y. manages to gain control of the suit and takes Tony to a safe location. Iron Man tracks Madame Masque to Marina del Rey. After finding a tape recorder with her messages, Tony is attacked by several black silhouettes with swords. [111]  Iron Man escapes the ninjas that are attacking him and manages to defeat most of them, but they kill themselves before he can interrogate any of them. Iron Man and Doctor Doom arrive at Mary Jane Watson \\'s newest Chicago night club Jackpot when Madame Masque attacks it. [112] As Mary Jane distracts Madame Masque by knocking off her mask, Iron Man and Doctor Doom discover that Madame Masque is possessed by a demon. Doctor Doom is able to perform an exorcism on her. [113]  Doctor Strange arrives and tells Iron Man he will take Madame Masque with him to fix her metaphysically and then hand her over at S.H.I.E.L.D. Iron Man also informs him of Doctor Doom\\'s help who had left the scene some time ago. Three days later, Iron Man offers Mary Jane a job to make up for the damage to her nightclub. [114] After speaking with War Machine, Tony Stark meets up at a diner with Amara Perera when they are unexpectedly joined by Doctor Doom who wanted to make sure that the demonic possession that affected Madame Masque has not affected Stark or Amara. [115] Stark shows Mary Jane the demonstration on the people that he will be working with. They are interrupted by F.R.I.D.A.Y. who tells Tony that War Machine is missing. [116] Before heading to Tokyo, Tony receives from Mary Jane the emergency number for Peter Parker. In Tokyo, Iron Man is contacted by Spider-Man at War Machine\\'s last known location as he is being observed by ninjas. [117]  During the Civil War II storyline, Iron Man protests the logic of using precognitive powers to stop future crimes after the recently emerged Inhuman Ulysses predicted Thanos \\'s attack on Project Pegasus. Three weeks later, Iron Man is summoned to the Triskelion after War Machine is killed in battle against Thanos. When Iron Man learns that War Machine and the Ultimates used Ulysses\\' power to ambush Thanos, he vows to stop anyone from using that power again. [118] Iron Man infiltrates New Attilan and makes off with Ulysses. At Stark Tower, Iron Man vows to find out how Ulysses\\' precognition works.  The Inhumans attack Stark Tower but are stopped by the Avengers, the Ultimates , and S.H.I.E.L.D. During the confrontation, Ulysses has another vision which he projects to Iron Man and everyone present, showing a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of the defeated superheroes. [119] The heroes confront Banner, who is killed by Hawkeye.  Barton claims that Banner was about to transform and Banner had previously asked Hawkeye to kill him if he should turn back into the Hulk. Tony is disgusted at this use of Ulysses\\' power. When his analysis of Ulysses brain is completed, [120] Tony reveals that Ulysses does not actually see the future , but simply assembles large quantities of data to project likely outcomes. While Danvers continues to use the visions as a resource, Tony objects to the concept of profiling people. This results in a stand-off when Tony\\'s side abducts a woman from custody after Ulysses\\' visions identified her as a deep-cover HYDRA agent, despite the lack of supporting evidence. [121]  Iron Man learns that his biological mother was actually Amanda Armstrong , who had given him up for adoption and that his biological father was a Hydra double agent named Jude . S.H.I.E.L.D. had Armstrong\\'s baby adopted by Howard and Maria Stark. [122]   Marvel NOW! 2016 [ edit ]  In July 2016, it was announced that Tony Stark would hand off the mantle of Iron Man to a 15-year-old girl named Riri Williams . Riri is an MIT student who built her own Iron Man suit out of scrap pieces and, as such, attracted Stark\\'s attention. Early depictions of Williams\\' suit depict it without the Arc Reactor, but leaves the power source for the suit unclear. [123] Another Iron Man-based series titled Infamous Iron Man debuted featuring Doctor Doom sporting his version of the Iron Man armor. [124] This is revealed to be the result of serious injuries sustained by Stark during his final confrontation with Captain Marvel.  Danvers\\' beating leaves Stark in a coma, but he is left alive due to unspecified experiments Stark has carried out on himself over the years. [125]   Existing as an A.I. [ edit ]  Following the revelation that Stark experimented on himself at the end of Civil War II , Beast concludes that the only option is to let the experiments do their job in healing Tony and recover on his own. [126] In Invincible Iron Man #1, an employee of Stark sends Riri Williams an artificial intelligence housing a copy of Tony Stark\\'s consciousness to help her control and mentor in her own version of the Iron Man armor. This A.I. is directly copied from Tony\\'s brain, granting sentience, with Williams commenting on Stark existing as a \"techno-ghost\". As an A.I., Stark can walk around as a hard-light object and gains the ability to remote control his vast armory of Iron Man suits. [127] In The Mighty Captain Marvel #3, the Tony Stark A.I. goes to Antarctica and visits Captain Marvel with the intent on settling their differences from the Second Civil War, she apologizes to him for her regrets, reconciles with him eventually and they become allies once more. Then in Secret Empire , the Tony Stark A.I. suits up as Iron Man once again and learns of Captain America\\'s betrayal to Hydra and how he ended up like this. As Hydra tightens its grip across America, the Tony Stark A.I. leads a team known as the Underground to find the Cosmic Cubes to restore Rogers to his normal self. When things start to escalate, Tony and his crew go rogue and in search for answers for the Cube. As Iron Man and the Underground search for them they are intercepted by Captain America and his Hydra team. With both teams encountering each other, they are captured by the Ultron/Hank Pym hybrid, who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table. During \"dinner\", Ultron reveals information about the Hydra Avengers - such as Odinson working with Hydra to reclaim Mjolnir, Scarlet Witch being possessed by Chthon, and Vision being affected by an A.I. virus. Ultron argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man, despite past experience confirming that this is not always a good idea, but Tony counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Hank\\'s abuse towards Wasp. Enraged, Ultron is about to kill everyone, but Ant-Man is able to calm him down by arguing that Hank remains his own inspiration. Ultron allows the Underground to leave with the fragment, arguing that neither side should have an advantage over the other. Back in America, Hydra Supreme has put Namor in a position where he will be forced to sign a peace treaty that gives Rogers access to the Cosmic Cube fragment in Atlantis, but Hydra Supreme muses that he is unconcerned about who will acquire the fragments, as he has an inside man in the Underground. After the Mount was attacked by Thor and the resurrected Hulk led by Hydra, the Underground evacuated the civilians thanks to Hawkeye and the rest of the heroes. Captain America and Iron Man fight as the Mount collapses around them. The Tony Stark A.I. initiates the Mount\\'s \"Clean Slate Protocol\", and blows up the Mount, killing Madame Hydra, then apologizes to Steve Rogers about their past differences, but the A.I survives and, in the aftermath, helps the heroes pull the pieces back together to take down Hydra. When Iron Man confronts Hydra Supreme, he and the other heroes are easily overpowered by him and watch the original Captain America defeat his Hydra self and into celebrating their victory. [128]   Marvel Legacy [ edit ]  Mary Jane Watson and other Stark employees find that Stark\\'s body has completely vanished from its pod, despite tests taken mere hours ago showing no sign of improvement or brain activity. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] [129] It was discovered that Tony Stark\\'s comatose body was taken to the Stark Industries Complex in Dover. [130] Upon awakening when his biological systems rebooted, Tony Stark went into hiding until he fully recovered. [131] Wanting to make sure that James Rhodes was in a similar state that he was in, Tony Stark exhumed his body from Arlington Cemetery and kick-started the biological systems in him. Afterwards, Iron Man and War Machine fought Hood to keep Stark Industries from falling into Hood\\'s hands where he switched to a version of his Extremis armor. Then he proceeded to defeat Jude when he turned up alive. [132]  During \"The Ultron Agenda\" arc, Iron Man went up against the Ultron/Hank Pym who begun a plan to merge humans with robots while taking up the name \"Ultron Pym.\" Iron Man was briefly fused with his armor. After using Stark Unlimited\\'s atomic separator on himself, Iron Man figured out that Hank Pym was dead the moment he accidentally fused with Ultron. Not wanting to prove Tony right, Ultron Pym surrendered to Iron Man and the Avengers. As it turned out that Iron Man actually died during the Civil War II storyline, Arno Stark used this to his advantage to acquire Stark Unlimited through a merger with Baintronics. With the combined resources, he built the Iron Man Armor Model 66 as his attempt to recreate the Godbuster Armor. Now having a new destiny, Arno Stark became the latest person to take on the Iron Man mantle. [133]  Because of his revelation that he is now a simulated A.I., Tony Stark became Mark One and started to establish the A.I. Army which also consists of Albert , Awesome Android , H.E.R.B.I.E. , M-11, Machine Man , Machinesmith , Quasimodo , the Dreadnoughts , a Sentinel , several Constructo-Bots, several Nick Fury LMDs, and an unnamed bomb disposal robot. This group of robots and androids want to obtain equal rights with organic beings through whatever way possible. Mark One provided them with a hideout on Floor Thirteen, a solid light construct that can only be accessed by robots and androids. With the establishment of Floor Thirteen, Mark One keeps the A.I. Army safe from their enemies and oppressors. [134]   Powers, abilities, and equipment [ edit ]  Armor [ edit ]  Main article: Iron Man\\'s armor   The Bleeding Edge Armor, like the Extremis Armor before it, is stored in Stark\\'s bones, and can be assembled and controlled by his thoughts  Iron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an array of weapons. The armor is invented and worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions). Other people who have assumed the Iron Man identity include Stark\\'s long-time partner and best friend James Rhodes ; [135] close associates Harold \"Happy\" Hogan ; Eddie March; [136] [137] (briefly) Michael O\\'Brien and Riri Williams. The weapons systems of the suit have changed over the years, but Iron Man\\'s standard offensive weapons have always been the repulsor rays that are fired from the palms of his gauntlets . Other weapons built into various incarnations of the armor include: the uni-beam projector in its chest; pulse bolts (that pick up kinetic energy along the way; so the farther they travel, the harder they hit); an electromagnetic pulse generator; and a defensive energy shield that can be extended up to 360 degrees. Other capabilities include: generating ultra- freon (i.e., a freeze-beam); creating and manipulating magnetic fields ; emitting sonic blasts; and projecting 3-dimensional holograms (to create decoys). In addition to the general-purpose model he wears, Stark has developed several specialized suits for space travel , [39]  deep-sea diving , stealth , [40] [41] and other special purposes. Stark has modified suits, like the Hulkbuster heavy armor. The Hulkbuster armor is composed of add-ons to his so-called modular armor, designed to enhance its strength and durability enough to engage the Hulk in a fight. A later model, created with the help of Odin and the Asgardian metal Uru, is similar to the Destroyer . Stark develops an electronics pack during the Armor Wars that, when attached to armors that use Stark technologies, will burn out those components, rendering the suit useless. This pack is ineffective on later models. While it is typically associated with James Rhodes , the War Machine armor began as one of Stark\\'s specialty armors. The most recent models of Stark\\'s armor, beginning with the Extremis armor, are now stored in the hollow portions of Stark\\'s bones, and the personal area networking implement used to control it is implanted into his forearm, and connected directly to his central nervous system . The Extremis has since been removed, [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] and he now uses more conventional armors. Some armors still take a liquid form, but are not stored within his body. His Endo-Sym Armor incorporates a combination of the liquid smart-metal with the alien Venom symbiote, psionically controlled by Stark. Post- Secret Wars , Stark uses a more streamlined suit of armor that uses nanotechnology to shape shift into other armors or weapons. [138]   Powers [ edit ]  After being critically injured during a battle with the Extremis-enhanced Mallen, Stark injects his nervous system with modified techno-organic virus-like body restructuring machines (the Extremis process). [139] By rewriting his own biology, Stark is able to save his life, gain an enhanced healing factor , and partially merge with the Iron Man armor, superseding the need for bulky, AI-controlled armors in favor of lighter designs, technopathically controlled by his own brain. His enhanced technopathy extends to every piece of technology, limitless and effortlessly due to his ability to interface with communication satellites and wireless connections to increase his \"range\". Some components of the armor-sheath are now stored in Tony\\'s body, able to be recalled, and extruded from his own skin, at will. During the \" Secret Invasion \" storyline the Extremis package is catastrophically shut down by a virus, forcing him again to rely on the previous iteration of his armor, and restoring his previous limitations. Furthermore, Osborn\\'s takeover of most of the few remaining Starktech factories, with Ezekiel Stane systematically crippling the others, limits Tony to the use of lesser, older and weaker armors. [140]  After being forced to \"wipe out\" his brain to prevent Norman Osborn from gaining his information, Tony Stark is forced to have a new arc reactor, of Rand design installed in his chest. The process greatly improves his strength, stamina and intellect. The procedure left him with virtually no autonomic functions: as his brain was stripped of every biological function, Tony is forced to rely on a digital backup of his memories (leaving him with severe gaps and lapses in his long-term memory) and on software routine in the arc reactor for basic stimuli reaction, such as blinking and breathing. [141] [142] The Bleeding Edge package of armor and physical enhancement is now equal in power, if not a more advanced, version of the old Extremis tech. [84]   Skills [ edit ]  Tony Stark is an inventive genius whose expertise in the fields of mathematics , physics , chemistry , and computer science rivals that of Reed Richards , Hank Pym , and Bruce Banner , and his expertise in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering surpasses even theirs. He is regarded as one of the most intelligent characters in the Marvel Universe. He graduated with advanced degrees in physics and engineering at the age of 17 from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) [143] and further developed his knowledge ranging from artificial intelligence to quantum mechanics as time progressed. His expertise extends to his ingenuity in dealing with difficult situations, such as difficult foes and deathtraps, in which he is capable of using available tools, including his suit, in unorthodox but effective ways. For instance, in Stark\\'s final confrontation with Obadiah Stane , the villain managed to have Stark\\'s companions in an unconscious state in a room with motion sensors ; when Stark entered the room, Stane warned him that the slightest move would trigger a fatal electrical current to his hostages, thus forcing Stark to stay still and slowly die of dehydration lest he wants his friends to die. However, while Stane was confident that such a trap was inescapable, Stark is able to outwit and defeat its mechanism in seconds, thus freeing the hostages and allowing him to continue the battle against Stane. [144]  He is well respected in the business world, able to command people\\'s attention when he speaks on economic matters, having over the years built up several multimillion-dollar companies from virtually nothing. He is noted for the loyalty he commands from and returns to those who work for him, as well as for his business ethics. Thus he immediately fired an employee who made profitable, but illegal, sales to Doctor Doom . [48] He strives to be environmentally responsible in his businesses. At a time when Stark was unable to use his armor for a period, he received some combat training from Captain America and has become physically formidable on his own when the situation demands it. [145] In addition, Stark possesses great business and political acumen. On multiple occasions he reacquired control of his companies after losing them amid corporate takeovers. [146]  Due to his membership in the Illuminati, Iron Man was given the Space Infinity Gem to safeguard. [147] It allows the user to exist in any location (or all locations), move any object anywhere throughout the universe and warp or rearrange space.  Supporting characters [ edit ]  Main article: List of Iron Man supporting characters  Other versions [ edit ]  1602 [ edit ]  1602: New World features a 17th-century Spanish Iron Man named Lord Iron . Taken captive in the Holy Land during the English / Spanish war, he is forced to make weapons for them after being tortured by David Banner, the later Hulk of that world. He needs his massive armor to survive. The armor is powered by \"lightning bottles\" and provides him with super-strength and invulnerability as well as several electricity-powered [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  With his Moorish associate, Rhodes, Lord Iron is assigned by King James to put an end to the traitors and witchbreed in the New World. Instead, he realizes he has let bitterness consume him, and makes his peace with Banner. He is last seen using his armor to power the colony\\'s printing press. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   1872 [ edit ]  The Secret Wars War Zone tie-in 1872 reimagines Tony in the Wild West. Tony was once a respected inventor who lives in the town of Timely.  When the Union army used his repeating rifle to slaughter a large group of Confederates rather let them surrender, Tony spirals into alcoholism. After Sheriff Steve Rogers is murdered by Mayor Wilson Fisk and his cohorts, Tony builds a large suit of armor resembling the original Iron Man suit to aid Red Wolf in bringing him down. After Fisk is defeated, Tony dedicates his time to aiding the people of Timely with his new invention. [148]   2020 [ edit ]  Iron Man 2020 features Arno Stark as a mercenary in the employ of Sunset Bain . [149] In 2012, Arno had traveled to the past in an effort to save his family from a madman\\'s bomb.  All he needs are the retinal patterns of the bomb maker, but he runs into the original Blizzard who mistakes him for the \"real\" Iron Man/Tony Stark. Not having time to deal with this threat, Arno kills Blizzard. While attempting to scan the retinal patterns of the young terrorist, Spider-Man snatches the scanner with his webbing and asks IM 2020 what he is doing. The two battle one another (Arno is \"against the clock\") when suddenly Arno is pulled back to his time to discover the bomb had a design flaw and exploded prematurely. His wife, son, employees, and factory have all been destroyed. [150]   2093 [ edit ]  Tony Stark and Doctor Doom are brought to the year 2093 by Merlin to stop a plot by a primarily robotic Doom and the Iron Man of 2093, Andros Stark. Andros is a psychotic madman and uses his grandfather Arno\\'s armor. Tony defeats Andros while wielding the legendary sword Excalibur . [151]  Andros Stark/Iron Man 2099 voiced by Alessandro Juliani would later be adopted into the second season of Iron Man: Armored Adventures with him being from the year 2099 and traveling back when Tony was a teenager before inventing a A.I. named \"Vortex\". Vortex dooms the entire human race with Andros donning a futuristic suit (classed \"Hyperspace Mark XL\") and the Extremis to kill Tony/Iron Man but goes to S.H.I.E.L.D. for assistance. Andros destroys Iron Man with his ultra-beam, afterward, Hawkeye managed to implant the virus on Andros\\'s armor, and realized that all this is because Tony was trying to save himself by using the virus to stop Andros using his nano-virus which is actually the original seed for the Vortex virus. He travels back in time for a short moment to warn Iron Man that his nano-virus chips were actually the Vortex virus. He quickly destroys the last nano-virus arrow, saving Andros. As a result of this change in the timeline, the future was saved and because of this, Andros is erased from existence after saying his last words to his grandfather. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   2099 [ edit ]  In the Marvel 2099 line, the new Iron Man of that era is a man named Sonny Frisco. Despite piloting a normal-sized suit of Iron Man armor, Frisco actually suffers from dwarfism . He is a member of the Alchemax corporation\\'s team of Avengers, and secretly uses the help of Vision , a woman with precognitive abilities. [152]   3030 [ edit ]  The Iron Man of 3030 is Tony Stark\\'s biracial granddaughter, Rhodey Stark (named after Stark\\'s close friend James Rhodes ). She travels to the present in order to help the Avengers save Earth from a rogue planet that had been fired from the future, and departs after warning her grandfather that his life is in danger. [153]   Adam Warlock [ edit ]  In Adam Warlock #2 (1972), Peter Parker\\'s counterpart on Counter-Earth mentions that \"the heart of Tony Stark beats unscathed\". [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Age of Apocalypse [ edit ]  In the Age of Apocalypse , Tony Stark is an agent of the Human High Council. The injury that compromised his heart is caused by the attack of a mutant . [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Age of X [ edit ]  Main article: Age of X  Officially code named Iron Man, he prefers the name Steel Corpse.  Iron Man was infected by a disease, thought to be of mutant origin, that bonded him permanently to his armor.  Not only can he never remove the armor, the disease is causing the armor to slowly consume his flesh, meaning that one day Tony Stark will cease to exist and only the armor will be left.  He works with this reality\\'s version of the Avengers to exterminate all mutants, but eventually rebells against his purpose when a \\'Trojan horse\\' in the armor nearly drives him to kill innocent mutant children, forcing his teammates to kill him. [154]   Avataars [ edit ]  In the sword and sorcery world of the Avataars: Covenant of the Shield miniseries, Iron Man\\'s counterpart is Ironheart, one of the Champions of the Realm. A powerful warrior, he wears a huge suit of grey armor. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Bullet Points [ edit ]  In Bullet Points , Iron Man is Steve Rogers , who, due to the assassination of Dr. Abraham Erskine occurring earlier than in the mainstream Marvel universe, never receives the Super-Soldier formula.  Instead, he agrees to be bonded to the prototype \\'Iron Man\\' armor despite the intense physical pain and discomfort this will cause. Rogers is later killed fighting an alternative version of the Hulk .  Tony Stark, in this reality a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. , expresses a desire to continue in Rogers\\' footsteps as Iron Man, but is rejected owing to a heart condition. He later disobeys this command and adopts the mantle upon the arrival of Galactus . [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Contest of Champions [ edit ]  The 2015 Contest of Champions series has a version of Tony Stark that won Civil War with nearly everything working out in his favor. Five years later, Tony has donned the Iron Patriot armor and is the President of the United States. He and his Mighty Avengers team are kidnapped by Maestro and placed onto Battleworld, where Maestro alters their memories to believe the remaining heroes are unregistered and need to be taken in. Their fight is interrupted by that universe\\'s Thunderbolts (led by Steve Rogers). [155] In the next issue, the Mighty Avengers battle the Thunderbolts and Renegade Champions, during which Tony kills Steve and reveals that the reason the Civil War went completely in his favor was because he used the Reality Gem from the Infinity Gauntlet. When he tries to use it again on Battleworld, it doesn\\'t work because he\\'s in a different dimension, and he\\'s killed by Maestro. [156]   Earth X [ edit ]  In the alternative reality of Earth X , Tony Stark builds a headquarters that protects himself from a plague that grants all humans superpowers. Afterwards, he builds the Iron Avengers. His headquarters is revealed to be a giant armor, based on the old Godzilla fighting mecha , the Red Ronin , which he uses to delay the Celestial attack until the coming of Galactus , sacrificing his life in the process. In Paradise X , he becomes part of the angelic Avenging Host of Marvel\\'s \"Paradise\", with an Iron Man motif. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Earth-691 [ edit ]  In the continuity of Earth-691 , Tony Stark is devastated by the horrors of the Martian invasion and jettisons his technology into space. It is found by a primitive alien race who use it to become an interstellar menace calling themselves the Stark, who subsequently clash with the Guardians of the Galaxy in the 31st century. [157] \"Standard\" continuity Iron Man (Earth-616) encountered his \"creations\" when a cadre of rational, scientific members of the Stark called the Programmers bring Tony Stark to the future to help them solve various planet-wide problems. [158]   Earth-2122 [ edit ]  In the continuity of Earth-2122 , the home of Crusader X , where the British won the American Revolution and still control North America, Anthony Stark is a member of a group called the Sons of Liberty. In this reality, Stark is willing to kill innocent people. [159]   Earth-3490 [ edit ]  In the continuity of Earth-3490 , Tony Stark was born a woman (Natasha Stark) rather than a man; Stark\\'s superhero alter-ego in this universe is Iron Woman. The Civil War between superheroes in Earth-3490 was averted due to the fact that Stark and Steve Rogers (Captain America) are romantically involved, and have since married. [160]   Exiles [ edit ]  In Exiles , a villainous alternative Iron Man of Earth-2020 is a member of Weapon X , the more ruthless team of reality fixers. [161] After ending up at the \\'Crystal Palace\\' (the Exiles\\' headquarters) and fighting them there, he is eventually exposed and sent back to his own timeline where he is arrested by the Army for starting a world war. [162]  In one alternative reality Tony Stark has become the absolute ruler of the entire planet Earth, and kills many of that Earth\\'s heroes and mutants. Weapon X arrives on this reality to help him conquer Attilan, though their true purpose is to cause his downfall. Tony is eventually killed by Susan Storm . [163]  In one alternative reality he is partners with both Mr. Fantastic and Doctor Octopus before he created the Iron Man suit. [164]  On an alternative world devastated by the Hulk \\'s Annihilation Wave , Iron Man was one of those killed in the attack. When the Exiles arrange for the dead heroes to be replaced by alternatives, Iron Man\\'s replacement is a version of Spitfire , on the grounds that they have never got along with any alternative Tony Starks. [165]  The Sons of Iron are a group of armor-wearing warriors from an Earth shared by humans and reptilian humanoids. Because they are completely concealed by the Iron Man armor, no-one can tell which they are. [166]  Fantastic Four: The End [ edit ]  In the miniseries Fantastic Four: The End , which is set in a future where Reed Richards \\' technology has launched humanity into a golden age, Tony Stark has died long ago - but his consciousness survives, \\'hopping\\' from artificial body to artificial body. Most of the bodies shown in the miniseries resemble Iron Man armors, often being identical to existing armors. One notable exception was the bulky, stocky space-armor which played an important role in the battle of humanity\\'s heroes versus several alien armadas. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   House of M [ edit ]  Born to Howard and Maria Stark, the heads of the powerful business conglomerate Stark Industries, Tony Stark grew to be an imaginative and brilliant inventor. He worked with his father from an early age, and surpassed his father\\'s technical brilliance by the age of 16.  Stark became the key supplier of hi-tech weaponry used to fight mutants, and was on the verge of a technological breakthrough when the Mutant-Human war came to an end.  The suits are powered down to become part of a game called Robo Death Match, a television sport with giant robots fighting each other.  Stark Industries scored its biggest victory when it secured the Sentinel production contracts, pushing major competitor, Jason Wyngarde , out of business. Erik Magnus and Sebastian Shaw awarded Tony the contract under the condition that he would hire Beast and Forge as observers. McCoy became a key contributor along with Doctor Pym on The Vision project . Tony secretly worked on a special project beneath Stark Industries: a brand new suit of hi-tech armor he planned to use as his new Robo Death Match suit. [167]   Iron Man: The End [ edit ]  In the one-shot Iron Man: The End , an aging Tony Stark works on his greatest creation, a space elevator called \"Big Jump.\" Stark faces retirement due to age and the physical toll of an illness, no longer allowing him to run his business \"Stark Universal\" and continue to be Iron Man. This leads to the need to groom a replacement. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Iron Maniac [ edit ]  Iron Maniac is an evil alternative universe version of Iron Man from Earth-5012. He first appeared in Marvel Team-Up (vol. 3) #2, wearing armor that resembles that of Doctor Doom \\'s.  He comes from an alternative reality where most of the Avengers were killed when they encountered the vicious alien Titannus in space. While the team is rescued by the reserve Avengers five years later, it takes another five years to fight back the Trellions, the alien race that has brainwashed Titannus.  During that time, a power-hungry Reed Richards turns his back on the surviving heroes. Scarred for life due to an attack from the Human Torch , Iron Man sets his own operation base in Latveria to \"take over the world to save it from Richards.\"  Richards somehow manages to banish him into Earth-616 Other differences between his world and Earth-616 include that there is no Spider-Man , and that Hank Pym is another version of the Hulk . [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  After being transported to Earth-616 , Iron Maniac fights the Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange , all of whom mistake him for their Doctor Doom.  After unmasking himself, they learn his true identity, shortly before he manages to temporarily negate the FF\\'s powers and escape, concluding that he has no reason to trust that they will not turn on him like the FF of his world did. Capturing a recently discovered mutant, the alternative Iron Man attempts to return to his home dimension by using the mutant as a power source, but is attacked by Spider-Man and X-23 as they investigate the situation. After the appearance of Captain America and Black Widow , he realizes that he is in an alternative world, but continues to fight the heroes, calling them all \\'Richards\\' lackeys\\', proclaiming that he can\\'t trust that they won\\'t turn into \\'villains\\' just as his own former allies did. He is defeated thanks to Spider-Man and X-23\\'s use of their own version of the fastball special to destroy his equipment, shortly after \\'warning\\' the other heroes of the Titannus War (by saying that he would not kill them now because it would be a kindness). [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  While the alternative Tony Stark is kept locked up and drugged in the S.H.I.E.L.D.  helicarrier , he is briefly visited by his counterpart in this universe, although he is unaware of the visit. Shortly after the alternative Stark is transferred to a conventional cell, Titannus soon arrives and fights the heroes, this time confronting a new group of Defenders assembled by Doctor Strange. When Titannus\\' comatose lover is revived, she tells him that she never loved him and that he was insane, causing Titannus to kill himself. The alternative Iron Man later discovers from Spider-Man and Wolverine that the Avengers were never massacred in space in this reality because the group had been disassembled ; as a result, other heroes only encountered Titannus after he had attacked Tokyo in a rage, leaving the heroes who did encounter him less inclined to believe his story and averting the so-called \\'Titannus War\\'. [168]  Stark subsequently broke free from captivity, having immunized himself to the gas that was used to keep him sedated on board the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. In the process, he gained the unwilling alliance of the LMD  Diamondback . Having convinced her that he is the \"real\" Tony, the AU Tony Stark erased her memories, reshaping the former LMD into an advanced suit of armor. This armor, even more advanced than the pre-Extremis suit Iron Man wore at that time, was able to replicate any weapon from the wearer\\'s memory. He subsequently battled Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America and Luke Cage , but was only defeated after the sacrifice of rookie hero Freedom Ring , who kept Iron Maniac occupied long enough for Captain America to knock him out with a shield thrown at the back of his neck. [169]  The name Iron Maniac is what he calls himself, due to being the \"sole survivor of a sane world living in a backwards, insane world\". [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Iron Maniac is known to be at least partially cyberized , with armor plating implanted in his chest (revealed during his escape from the Helicarrier, when he is shot).  It is unknown whether the rest of his body is similarly armored or if he possesses other cybernetic enhancements. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  He has been briefly mentioned as being held in a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier recently in The Irredeemable Ant-Man . [ citation needed ]   Iron Man Noir [ edit ]  In Iron Man Noir , Tony Stark is an industrialist in the 1930s. He is also an adventurer, whose exploits are recorded in Marvels: A Magazine Of Men\\'s Adventure . He is initially accompanied by his associate James Rhodes , his personal assistant Giulietta Nefaria and his biographer Vergil Munsey. When Nefaria is revealed as working with the Nazis (specifically Baron Zemo and Baron von Strucker ) and Vergil is killed, their role in the story is taken by Stark\\'s new biographer Pepper Potts . His heart having been damaged on an earlier adventure, Stark keeps it going with repulsor technology installed and recharged by Stark Industries engineer Edwin Jarvis . [170]  While investigating a mysterious power source in the ruins of Atlantis , Pepper Potts gets kidnapped by the Nazis and taken to their stronghold in Norway. To rescue her, Stark and Rhodes don suits of bulky power armour built by Jarvis, but are shocked to discover that \\'Baron Zemo\\' is actually Tony\\'s missing father Howard Stark , brainwashed by a unique chemical compound to serve the Nazis. Despite his depleted power supply, Tony manages to destroy the various suits of armor that Zemo had built for the Nazis, concluding that his father had died long ago, before returning to the USA. [171]   Inter-company crossovers [ edit ]  In Marvel and DC \\'s Amalgam Comics , Stark is merged with the Green Lantern Hal Jordan into the Iron Lantern. \"Hal Stark\" wears a suit resembling a green Iron Man armor, powered by a Green Lantern battery. [172]  In the miniseries JLA/Avengers , Iron Man aids the Avengers in the battle against Starro the Conqueror . Afterwards, he creates a dimensional alarm in order to tell when invaders from another dimension come into their universe. After a brief scuffle with the JLA in the Savage Land, the Avengers are confronted by Metron , who gives Tony a Mother Box . Using this, Tony is able to get the Avengers to Metropolis , where the Avengers confront the JLA again. [173] The Avengers escape, but Tony and Hawkeye manage to take Green Lantern \\'s Power Battery before they leave, with Tony able to stop the Flash in his tracks. The two later take down Captain Atom and Green Arrow in order to collect the Casket of Ancient Winters . Tony then leaves and arrives to save Photon and Quasar from Wonder Woman and Green Lantern, allowing them to take the Spear of Destiny. [174] After the battle in the Savage Land, Tony is one of the Avengers and is clueless as to the dimensional shifts that are happening around him. After Cap and Superman attack each other, Tony ends up in Metropolis. When the two worlds are briefly corrected by the Grandmaster , Tony is shown his true future with his alcoholism and his defeat by Obadiah Stane . [175] Accepting this, he aids the JLA and the Avengers in the final battle and helped build the ship that took them to Krona \\'s base. During the battle, he teams up with Kyle Rayner to create a weapon to use against their enemies and the two are shown to be impressed by one another, Kyle expressing his awe at Tony\\'s engineering prowess and Tony asking Kyle where he could get a Green Lantern ring. [176]   Mangaverse [ edit ]  In the Marvel Mangaverse reality, Tony Stark creates the original armor together with Dr. Ho Yinsen and acts as Iron Man for a time, but eventually vanishes after a battle with Namor , the Submariner. He is succeeded by Antoinette (Toni) Stark, his twin sister, a former agent of SHIELD, who turns Iron Man into a massive operation - a veritable army of Iron Men in many forms, with herself as Iron Woman. After she dies in battle against the Hulk , Tony Stark reveals himself again; he has gone underground after spinal cancer reduced him to a disembodied head hooked up to a life support system. However, he has designed a new armor, and a body that he can integrate with. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  He also had designed four massive vehicles for the Avengers of his world to use, which could combine (in a manner resembling old fashioned combining super robots like Combattler V and Voltes V ) into a skyscraper-sized Iron Man- mecha (Dubbed Ultimate Iron Man in its first appearance, then the Iron Avenger in its battle with the Hulk and finally simply called \"the Avenger\\'s mecha\" in Volume 2 of the series). Unfortunately it was quickly destroyed by that world\\'s Hulk. Apparently, however, it was rebuilt again by the time of the second volume, this time as a single robotic unit without transformation (or, if it was capable of transformation, it was never demonstrated). This unit helped fight off the giant Galactus spores, but was later destroyed, along with most of the Avengers, single-handedly by the Mangaverse version of Dr. Doom . [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Marvel Adventures [ edit ]  The Marvel Adventures Iron Man is very similar to the Earth-616 Iron Man, but with some changes. Instead of suffering damage to his heart due to a booby trap in Vietnam, Tony Stark\\'s heart was damaged when an experimental plane he was flying was brought down by AIM . AIM wanted Stark to build weapons and devices for them.  Dr. Gia-Bao Yinsen aided Tony in escaping AIM, but Yinsen died saving his country from AIM.  Iron Man does not seem to have problems with alcoholism, since the Marvel Adventures is aimed at a younger demographic.  Iron Man\\'s armor resembles his Extremis armor although Iron Man has other armors that fit over his regular armor, as in the case of his underwater armor. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Marvel Apes [ edit ]  The version of Iron Man appearing in the Marvel Apes mini-series is a mandrill, appropriately being named the Iron Mandrill.  He is a member of the Apevengers.  At one point, he is attacked by the zombified Wasp of the Marvel Zombies universe and infected, though he is later apparently cured when these events are undone via time travel. [177] [178] [179]   Marvel Zombies [ edit ]  The first series [ edit ]  In  the Marvel Zombies universe, Tony Stark has been infected by the zombie virus.  Alongside a horde of starving undead superhuman zombies, Iron Man attacks the Silver Surfer . The attack is successful, but one of the Surfer\\'s energy bolts hits Iron Man\\'s lower torso, cutting him in half. The zombie \"survives\" this wound and later gains cosmic powers (including flight) by eating part of the Surfer\\'s corpse.

He was shocked to see Forge, one of the surviving X-Men, wearing his Mark I armored suit . The zombified Hulk kills Iron Man when he stomps through the armor, forcing Tony Stark\\'s flesh and blood through any openings left in the armor.

Zombie Giant Man infects Happy Hogan , Pepper Potts and a number of other people at Stark Industries . A drunken Tony Stark lacks the will power to become Iron Man despite Pepper Potts\\' requests, so James Rhodes dons the suit to save him.  Crucial to fate of the multiverse are the nanites that Stark has accidentally created, which destroy damaged flesh and tissue as a cure for cancer, and prove to be a potent weapon against the zombies. This was grafted onto Flint Marko \\'s body. He sacrifices himself to kill several zombies in Stark Tower, with Rhodes permanently succeeding him in the role of Iron Man. [180] His nanites are then used by his successor, now a member of the New Avengers , years later to kill the remaining super-powered zombies and end the inter-dimensional zombie threat.

Among those who vanished was Ghost Rider, and, being present at the battle during which he was erased, Iron Man takes his place.  The Newer Fantastic Four soon realize they are outmatched.  Stark, with help from the Hulk, manages to salvage the empty armor of Ziran, a Celestial , and realizes it can be controlled by thoughts. Stark takes control of the armor and connects it to the Negative Zone , allowing him to call on all the power of that reality. Despite this, he is defeated by Thanos.  Stark\\'s sacrifice allows Wolverine to trick Thanos into a position where the Gauntlet could be removed.  Spider-Man subsequently uses the Gauntlet to undo the damage Thanos had caused. [189]   Iron Man: Demon in an Armor [ edit ]  In What If: Iron Man: Demon in an Armor , Tony Stark is Doom\\'s college roommate rather than Reed Richards, inspiring Doom to develop a machine that allows him to transfer his mind into Stark\\'s body while leaving Stark trapped in Doom\\'s body with no memory of his past. While Doom uses Stark\\'s connections and company to establish himself, the amnesic Stark- believing himself to be Doom- works to rebuild his life, creating his own company and forming his own reputation from the ground up. This culminates in a confrontation between the two wearing early versions of their respective armours- Doom having developed a green-and-silver Iron Man armour while Stark has created Doom\\'s costume with gold and a red cloak-, during which Doom reveals the truth about their switch, only for Stark to reject the offer to switch back because Doom has destroyed the name of Tony Stark while Doctor von Doom has developed an honorable reputation.

[191] However, as part of his efforts to undermine the Consortium\\'s anti-mutant agenda, he becomes Nick Fury \\'s insider and eventually sacrifices his life along with Beast . [192] He assists Storm- who has been split into an amnesic child version of herself and an energy form with full memory and no body- by providing her energy self with a suit based on the now-deceased Black Panther so that her energy can maintain corporeal form, although he is subsequently killed by a twisted clone of Storm before he can reveal her existence to anyone else.

Created by cartoonists  Joe Simon and Jack Kirby , the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 ( cover dated March 1941) from Timely Comics , a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics\\' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication. The character wears a costume bearing an American flag  motif , and he utilizes a nearly indestructible shield that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers , a frail young artist enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental \" super-soldier serum \" after joining the military to aid the United States government\\'s efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected figure in his community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers . Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 movie serial , Captain America . Since then, the character has been featured in other films and television series . In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the character is portrayed by Chris Evans . Captain America was ranked sixth on IGN \\'s \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time\" in 2011, [1] second in their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\" in 2012, [2] and second in their \"Top 25 best Marvel superheroes\" list in 2014.

[4] \"I wrote the name \\'Super American\\' at the bottom of the page,\" Simon said in his autobiography, and then decided:  .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} No, it didn\\'t work. There were too many \"Supers\" around. \"Captain America\" had a good sound to it. There weren\\'t a lot of captains in comics. It was as easy as that. The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky Pierson, a star on our high school basketball team. [5]  Simon recalled in his autobiography that Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman gave him the go-ahead and directed that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible. Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character\\'s stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist Jack Kirby , could handle the workload alone:  I didn\\'t have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue\\xa0... There were two young artists from Connecticut that had made a strong impression on me. Al Avison and Al Gabriele often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby\\'s. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new Captain America book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. \"You\\'re still number one, Jack,\" I assured him. \"It\\'s just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue.\"\\n\"I\\'ll make the deadline,\" Jack promised. \"I\\'ll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline.\" I hadn\\'t expected this kind of reaction\\xa0... but I acceded to Kirby\\'s wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby\\xa0... I wrote the first Captain America book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and popping up the action as only he could. Then he tightened up the penciled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures.\" [5]   1974 Comic Art Convention program featuring Simon\\'s original sketch of Captain America  Al Lieberman would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby\\'s regular letterer, Howard Ferguson. [6]  Simon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of Nazi Germany in the years leading up to the United States\\' involvement in World War II and felt war was inevitable: \"The opponents to the war were all quite well organized. We wanted to have our say too.\" [7]   Golden Age [ edit ]   Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). Cover art by Joe Simon (inks and pencils) and Jack Kirby (pencils).  Captain America Comics #1 — cover-dated March 1941 [8] and on sale December 20, 1940, [9] [10] a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor , but a full year into World War II — showed the protagonist punching Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ; it sold nearly one million copies. [11] While most readers responded favorably to the comic, some took objection. Simon noted, \"When the first issue came out we got a lot of\\xa0 ... threatening letters and hate mail. Some people really opposed what Cap stood for.\" [7] The threats, which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices, proved so serious that police protection was posted with New York Mayor  Fiorello La Guardia personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his support. [12]  Though preceded as a \"patriotically themed superhero\" by MLJ \\'s The Shield , Captain America immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during World War II, [13] as evidenced by the unusual move at the time of premiering the character in his own title instead of an anthology title first. This popularity drew the attention and a complaint from MLJ that the character\\'s triangular shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of their Shield character. In response, Goodman had Simon and Kirby create a distinctive round shield for issue 2, which went on to become an iconic element of the character. [14] With his sidekick Bucky , Captain America faced Nazis , Japanese , and other threats to wartime America and the Allies . Stanley Lieber, now better known as Stan Lee , contributed to the character in issue #3 in the filler text story \"Captain America Foils the Traitor\\'s Revenge\", which introduced the character\\'s use of his shield as a returning throwing weapon. [15] Captain America soon became Timely\\'s most popular character and even had a fan-club called the \"Sentinels of Liberty\". [7]  Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue, which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as Time during the period. [13] [16] The character was widely imitated by other comics publishers, with around 40 red-white-and-blue patriotic heroes debuting in 1941 alone. [17] After the Simon and Kirby team moved to DC Comics in late 1941, having produced Captain America Comics through issue #10 (January 1942), Al Avison and Syd Shores became regular pencillers of the celebrated title, with one generally inking over the other. The character was featured in All Winners Comics #1–19 (Summer 1941 – Fall 1946), Marvel Mystery Comics #80–84 and #86–92, USA Comics #6–17 (Dec. 1942 – Fall 1945), and All Select Comics #1–10 (Fall 1943 – Summer 1946). In the post-war era, with the popularity of superheroes fading, Captain America led Timely\\'s first superhero team, the All-Winners Squad , in its two published adventures, in All Winners Comics #19 and #21 (Fall–Winter 1946; there was no issue #20). After Bucky was shot and wounded in a 1948 Captain America story, he was succeeded by Captain America\\'s girlfriend, Betsy Ross, who became the superheroine Golden Girl . Captain America Comics ran until issue #73 (July 1949), [18] at which time the series was retitled Captain America\\'s Weird Tales for two issues, [19] with the finale being a horror/suspense anthology issue with no superheroes. Atlas Comics attempted to revive its superhero titles when it reintroduced Captain America, along with the original Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner, in Young Men #24 (Dec. 1953). Billed as \"Captain America, Commie Smasher!\" Captain America appeared during the next year in Young Men #24–28 and Men\\'s Adventures #27–28, as well as in issues #76–78 of an eponymous title. Atlas\\' attempted superhero revival was a commercial failure, [20] and the character\\'s title was canceled with Captain America #78 (Sept. 1954).  Silver and Bronze Age [ edit ]   Avengers #4 (March 1964). Cover art by Jack Kirby and George Roussos .  In the Human Torch story titled \"Captain America\" in Marvel Comics\\' Strange Tales #114 (Nov. 1963), [21] writer-editor Stan Lee and artist and co-plotter Jack Kirby depicted the brash young Fantastic Four member Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, in an exhibition performance with Captain America, described as a legendary World War II and 1950s superhero who has returned after many years of apparent retirement. The 18-page story ends with this Captain America revealed as an impostor: it was actually the villain the Acrobat, a former circus performer the Torch had defeated in Strange Tales #106, who broke two thieves out of jail, hoping to draw the police away while trying to rob the local bank. Afterward, Storm digs out an old comic book in which Captain America is shown to be Steve Rogers. A caption in the final panel says this story was a test to see if readers would like Captain America to return. According to Lee, fan response to the tryout was very enthusiastic. [22]  Captain America was then formally reintroduced in The Avengers #4 (March 1964), [23] which explained that in the final days of World War II, he had fallen from an experimental drone plane into the North Atlantic Ocean and spent decades frozen in a block of ice in a state of suspended animation . The hero found a new generation of readers as leader of that superhero team. Following the success of other Marvel characters introduced during the 1960s, Captain America was recast as a hero \"haunted by past memories, and trying to adapt to 1960s society\". [24]  After then guest-starring in the feature \" Iron Man \" in Tales of Suspense #58 (Oct. 1964), Captain America gained his own solo feature in that \"split book\", beginning the following issue. [25] Issue #63 (March 1965), which retold Captain America\\'s origin, through issue #71 (Nov. 1965) was a period feature set during World War II and co-starred Captain America\\'s Golden Age sidekick, Bucky. Kirby drew all but two of the stories in Tales of Suspense, which became Captain America with #100 (April 1968); [26]  Gil Kane and John Romita Sr. , each filled in once. Several stories were finished by penciller-inker George Tuska over Kirby layouts, with one finished by Romita Sr. and another by penciller Dick Ayers and inker John Tartaglione . Kirby\\'s regular inkers on the series were Frank Giacoia (as \"Frank Ray\") and Joe Sinnott , though Don Heck and Golden Age Captain America artist Syd Shores inked one story each.  A story in issue #155-157 revealed the 1950s \"Commie Smasher\" Captain America and Bucky to be imposters. This series — considered Captain America volume one by comics researchers and historians, [27] following the 1940s Captain America Comics and its 1950s numbering continuation of Tales of Suspense — ended with #454 (Aug. 1996). This series was almost immediately followed by the 13-issue Captain America vol. 2 (Nov. 1996 – Nov. 1997, part of the \" Heroes Reborn \" crossover), [28] the 50-issue Captain America vol. 3 (Jan. 1998 – Feb. 2002), [29] the 32-issue Captain America vol. 4 (June 2002 – Dec. 2004), [30] and Captain America vol. 5 (Jan. 2005 – Aug. 2011). [31] Beginning with the 600th overall issue (Aug. 2009), Captain America resumed its original numbering, as if the series numbering had continued uninterrupted after #454.  Modern Age [ edit ]  As part of the aftermath of Marvel Comics\\' company-crossover storyline \" Civil War \", Steve Rogers was ostensibly killed in Captain America vol. 5, #25 (March 2007). The storyline of Rogers\\' return began in issue #600. [32] [33] Rogers, who was not dead but caroming through time, returned to the present day in the six-issue miniseries Captain America: Reborn (Sept. 2009 – March 2010). [34]  After Rogers\\' return, Barnes, at Rogers\\' insistence, continued as Captain America, beginning in the one-shot comic Captain America: Who Will Wield the Shield? (Feb. 2010). While Bucky Barnes continued adventuring in the pages of Captain America , Steve Rogers received his own miniseries ( Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier ) as well as taking on the leadership position in a new Secret Avengers ongoing series. Spinoff series included Captain America Sentinel of Liberty (Sept. 1998 – Aug. 1999) and Captain America and the Falcon (May 2004 – June 2005). The 1940s Captain America appeared alongside the 1940s Human Torch and Sub-Mariner in the 12-issue miniseries  Avengers/Invaders . [35] [36] The 2007 mini-series  Captain America: The Chosen , written by David Morrell and penciled by Mitchell Breitweiser, depicts a dying Steve Rogers\\' final minutes, at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, as his spirit guides James Newman, a young American Marine fighting in Afghanistan . The Chosen is not part of the main Marvel Universe continuity. [37] [38]  During the \"Two Americas\" storyline that ran in issues #602-605, the series drew controversy for the similarity between protesters depicted in the comic and the Tea Party movement . Particularly drawing scorn was a panel of a protester holding sign that read \"Tea Bag the Libs Before They Tea Bag You!\" [39] Also drawing controversy were remarks made by the Falcon implying that the crowd is racist. [40] In his column on Comic Book Resources , Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada apologized for the sign, claiming that it was a mistake, added by the letterer at the last minute. [41]  The character, first as agent Steve Rogers and later after resuming his identity as Captain America, appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 Avengers series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). The character appeared as agent Steve Rogers as a regular character in the 2010–2013 Secret Avengers series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through issue #21 (March 2012); the character made guest appearances as Captain America in issues #21.1, #22–23, #35, and the final issue of the series #37 (March 2013). Marvel stated in May 2011 that Rogers, following the public death of Bucky Barnes in the Fear Itself miniseries, would resume his Captain America identity in a sixth volume of Captain America , by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Steve McNiven . [42] [43] The Captain America title continued from issue #620 featuring team up stories with Bucky (#620-#628), [44] Hawkeye (#629-#632), [45] Iron Man (#633–635), [46] Namor (#635.1), [47] and Black Widow (#636-#640), [48] and the title ended its print run with issue #640. Captain America is a regular character in Uncanny Avengers (2012), beginning with issue #1 as part of Marvel NOW! . Captain America vol. 7 was launched in November 2012 with a January 2013 cover date by writer Rick Remender and artist John Romita Jr. . [49]  On July 16, 2014, Marvel Comics announced that the mantle of Captain America would be passed on by Rogers (who in the most recent storyline has been turned into a 90-year-old man) to his long-time ally The Falcon , with the series being relaunched as All-New Captain America . [50]  Marvel announced that Rogers will become Captain America once again in the comic series Captain America: Steve Rogers . [51] This new series follows the events of \" Avengers: Standoff! ,\" in which Captain America is restored to his youthful state following an encounter with the sentient Cosmic Cube, Kobik, and his past is drastically rewritten under the instructions of the Red Skull. Afterward, Captain America plots to set himself and Hydra in a position where they can conquer America in Marvel\\'s event \" Secret Empire .\" [52]   Legal status [ edit ]  In 1966, Joe Simon sued the owners of Marvel Comics, asserting that he—not Marvel—was legally entitled to renew the copyright upon the expiration of the original 28-year term. The two parties settled out of court, with Simon agreeing to a statement that the character had been created under terms of employment by the publisher, and therefore it was work for hire owned by them. [53]  In 1999, Simon filed to claim the copyright to Captain America under a provision of the Copyright Act of 1976 , which allowed the original creators of works that had been sold to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56-year copyright term (but not the longer term enacted by the new legislation) had expired. Marvel Entertainment challenged the claim, arguing that the settlement of Simon\\'s 1966 suit made the character ineligible for termination of the copyright transfer. Simon and Marvel settled out of court in 2003, in a deal that paid Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing use of the character. [53] [54]   Fictional character biography [ edit ]  20th century [ edit ]  1940s [ edit ]   Captain America and Bucky\\'s debuts, in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941 Timely Comics). Art by Jack Kirby .  Steven Rogers was born in the Lower East Side of Manhattan , New York City , in 1920 to poor Irish immigrants, Sarah and Joseph Rogers. [55] Joseph died when Steve was a child, and Sarah died of pneumonia while Steve was a teen. By early 1940, before America\\'s entry into World War II , Rogers is a tall, scrawny fine arts student specializing in illustration and a comic book writer and artist. Disturbed by the devastation of Europe by the Nazis, Rogers attempts to enlist but is rejected due to his frail body. His resolution attracts the notice of U.S. Army General Chester Phillips and \"Project: Rebirth\". Rogers is used as a test subject for the Super-Soldier project, receiving a special serum made by \"Dr. Josef Reinstein\", [56] [57] later retroactively changed to a code name for the scientist Abraham Erskine . [58]  The serum is a success and transforms Steve Rogers into a nearly perfect human being with peak strength, agility, stamina, and intelligence. The success of the program leaves Erskine wondering about replicating the experiment on other human beings. [57] The process itself has been inconsistently detailed: While in the original material Rogers is shown receiving injections of the Super-Serum, when the origin was retold in the 1960s, the Comic Code Authority had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse, and thus the Super-Serum was retconned into an oral formula. [59]  Erskine refused to write down every crucial element of the treatment, leaving behind a flawed, imperfect knowledge of the steps. Thus, when the Nazi spy  Heinz Kruger killed him, Erskine\\'s method of creating new Super-Soldiers died. Captain America, in his first act after his transformation, avenges Erskine. In the 1941 origin story and in Tales of Suspense #63, Kruger dies when running into machinery but is not killed by Rogers; in the Captain America #109 and #255 revisions, Rogers causes the spy\\'s death by punching him into machinery. [57]  Unable to create new Super-Soldiers and willing to hide the Project Rebirth fiasco, the American government casts Rogers as a patriotic superhero, able to counter the menace of the Red Skull as a counter-intelligence agent. He is supplied with a patriotic uniform of his own design, [55] a bulletproof shield, a personal side arm , and the codename Captain America, while posing as a clumsy infantry private at Camp Lehigh in Virginia. He forms a friendship with the camp\\'s teenage mascot , James Buchanan \"Bucky\" Barnes. [56]  Barnes learns of Rogers\\' dual identity and offers to keep the secret if he can become Captain America\\'s sidekick . During their adventures, Franklin D. Roosevelt presents Captain America with a new shield , forged from an alloy of steel and vibranium , fused by an unknown catalyst, so effective that it replaces his own firearm. [58] Throughout World War II, Captain America and Bucky fight the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team the Invaders as seen in the 1970s comic of the same name. [60] Captain America fights in numerous battles in World War II, primarily as a member of 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment \"Blue Spaders\". [61] Captain America battles a number of criminal menaces on American soil, including a wide variety of costumed villains: the Wax Man, [62] the Hangman, [63] the Fang, [64] the Black Talon, [65] and the White Death, [66] among others. In addition to Bucky, Captain America was occasionally assisted by the Sentinels of Liberty . [67] Sentinels of Liberty was the title given to members of the Captain America Comics fan club who Captain America sometimes addressed as an aside, or as characters in the Captain America Comics stories. In late April 1945, during the closing days of World War II, Captain America and Bucky try to stop the villainous Baron Zemo from destroying an experimental drone plane. Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive on it with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit. The pair reaches the plane just before takeoff. When Bucky tries to defuse the bomb, it explodes in mid-air. Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic. Both are presumed dead, though it is later revealed that neither had died. [68]   Late 1940s to 1950s [ edit ]  Captain America appeared in comics for the next few years, changing from World War II-era hero fighting the Nazis to confronting the United States\\' newest enemy, Communism . The revival of the character in the mid-1950s was short-lived, and events during that time period are later retconned to show that multiple people operated using the code name to explain the changes in the character. These post World War II successors are listed as William Naslund and Jeffrey Mace . They are assisted by Fred Davis continuing the role of Bucky. The last of these other official Captains, William Burnside , [69] was a history graduate enamored with the Captain America mythos, having his appearance surgically altered to resemble Rogers and legally changing his name to \"Steve Rogers\", becoming the new \"1950s Captain America\". [70] He administered to himself and his pupil James \"Jack\" Monroe a flawed, incomplete copy of the Super-Serum, which made no mention about the necessary Vita-Ray portion of the treatment. As a result, while Burnside and Monroe became the new Captain America and Bucky, they became violently paranoid, often raving about innocent people being communist sympathizers during the height of the Red Scare of the 1950s. Their insanity forced the U.S. government to place them in indefinite cryogenic storage until they could be cured of their mental illness. [71] Monroe would later be cured and assume the Nomad identity. [72]   1960s to 1970s [ edit ]  Years later, the superhero team the Avengers discovers Steve Rogers\\' body in the North Atlantic. After he revives, they piece together that Rogers has been preserved in a block of ice since 1945, surviving because of his enhancements from Project: Rebirth. The block began to melt after the Sub-Mariner , enraged that an Inuit tribe is worshipping the frozen figure, throws it into the ocean. [68] Rogers accepts membership in the Avengers, and his experience in individual combat service and his time with the Invaders makes him a valuable asset. He quickly assumes leadership [73] and has typically returned to that position throughout the team\\'s history.   Captain America #180 (Dec. 1974). Captain America becomes \"Nomad\". Cover art by Gil Kane and Frank Giacoia .  Captain America is plagued by guilt for having been unable to prevent Bucky\\'s death. Although he takes the young Rick Jones (who closely resembles Bucky) under his tutelage, he refuses for some time to allow Jones to take up the Bucky identity, not wishing to be responsible for another youth\\'s death. Insisting that his hero move on from that loss, Jones convinces Rogers to let him don the Bucky costume, [74] but this partnership lasts only a short time; a disguised Red Skull , impersonating Rogers with the help of the Cosmic Cube , drives Jones away. Rogers reunites with his old war comrade Nick Fury , who is similarly well-preserved due to the \"Infinity Formula\". As a result, Rogers regularly undertakes missions for the security agency S.H.I.E.L.D. , for which Fury is public director. [75] Through Fury, Rogers befriends Sharon Carter , a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, [76] with whom he eventually begins a romantic relationship. Rogers later meets and trains Sam Wilson, who becomes the superhero the Falcon , [77] the first African-American superhero in mainstream comic books. [78] [79] The characters established an enduring friendship and adventuring partnership, sharing the series title for some time as Captain America and the Falcon . [80] The two later encounter the revived but still insane 1950s Captain America . [70] [71] [81] [82] [83] Although Rogers and the Falcon defeat the faux Rogers and Jack Monroe, Rogers becomes deeply disturbed that he could have suffered his counterpart\\'s fate. During this period, Rogers temporarily gains super strength. [84]  The series dealt with the Marvel Universe \\'s version of the Watergate scandal , [85] [86] [87] making Rogers so uncertain about his role that he abandons his Captain America identity in favor of one called Nomad , [88] emphasizing the word\\'s meaning as \"man without a country\". During this time, several men unsuccessfully assume the Captain America identity. [89] Rogers eventually re-assumes it after coming to consider that the identity could be a symbol of American ideals and not its government; it\\'s a personal conviction epitomized when he later confronted a corrupt Army officer attempting to manipulate him by appealing to his loyalty, \"I\\'m loyal to nothing, General\\xa0 ... except the [American] Dream.\" Jack Monroe, cured of his mental instability, later takes up the Nomad alias. [90] Sharon Carter is believed to have been killed while under the mind control of Dr. Faustus . [91]   1980s to 1990s [ edit ]   Captain America #350 (February 1989). Rogers as \"the Captain\" vs. John Walker as Captain America. Cover art by Kieron Dwyer and Al Milgrom .  The 1980s included a run by writer Roger Stern and artist John Byrne . Stern had Rogers consider a run for President of the United States in Captain America #250 (June 1980), [92] an idea originally developed by Roger McKenzie and Don Perlin . Stern, in his capacity as editor of the title, originally rejected the idea but later changed his mind about the concept. [93] [94] McKenzie and Perlin received credit for the idea on the letters page at Stern\\'s insistence. [95] Stern additionally introduced a new love interest, law student Bernie Rosenthal , in Captain America #248 (Aug. 1980). [96]  Writer J. M. DeMatteis revealed the true face and full origin of the Red Skull in Captain America #298–300, and had Captain America take on Jack Monroe, Nomad, as a partner for a time. [90] The heroes gathered by the Beyonder elect Rogers as leader during their stay on Battleworld . [97]  Homophobia is dealt with as Rogers runs into a childhood friend named Arnold Roth who is gay. [98] [99]  Mark Gruenwald became the writer of the series with issue #307 (July 1985) and wrote 137 issues for 10 consecutive years from until #443 (Sept. 1995), [100] the most issues by any single author in the character\\'s history. Gruenwald created several new foes, including Crossbones and the Serpent Society. Other Gruenwald characters included Diamondback , [101]  Super Patriot , [102] and Demolition Man . [103] Gruenwald explored numerous political and social themes as well, such as extreme idealism when Captain America fights the anti-nationalist terrorist Flag-Smasher ; [104] and vigilantism when he hunts the murderous Scourge of the Underworld . [105]  Rogers receives a large back-pay reimbursement dating back to his disappearance at the end of World War II, and a government commission orders him to work directly for the U.S. government. Already troubled by the corruption he had encountered with the Nuke incident in New York City , where the gangster supervillain, The Kingpin , used his corrupted contacts in the US military to have the psychopathic test subject of a secret failed attempt to recreate Project Rebirth\\'s body enhancements, Nuke , attack Hell\\'s Kitchen in a murderous rampage to draw Daredevil out of hiding [106] Rogers chooses instead to resign his identity, [107] [108] and then takes the alias of \"the Captain\". [109] A replacement Captain America, John Walker, struggles to emulate Rogers\\' ideals until pressure from hidden enemies helps to drive Walker insane. Rogers returns to the Captain America identity [110] while a recovered Walker becomes the U.S. Agent . [111]  Sometime afterward, Rogers avoids the explosion of a methamphetamine lab, but the drug triggers a chemical reaction in the Super Soldier Serum in his system. To combat the reaction, Rogers has the serum removed from his body and trains constantly to maintain his physical condition. [112] A retcon later establishes that the serum was not a drug per se , which would have metabolized out of his system, but in fact a virus-like organism that effected a biochemical and genetic change. This additionally explained how nemesis the Red Skull , who at the time inhabited a body cloned from Rogers\\' cells, has the formula in his body. Because of his altered biochemistry, Rogers\\' body begins to deteriorate, and for a time he must wear a powered exoskeleton and is eventually placed again in suspended animation. During this time, he is given a transfusion of blood from the Red Skull , which cures his condition and stabilizes the Super-Soldier virus in his system. Captain America returns to crime fighting and the Avengers. [113] [114]  Following Gruenwald\\'s departure from the series, Mark Waid took over and resurrected Sharon Carter as Cap\\'s love interest. The title was then relaunched under Rob Liefeld as Cap became part of the Heroes Reborn universe for 13 issues [115] before another relaunch restored Waid to the title [116] in an arc that saw Cap lose his shield for a time using an energy based shield as a temporary replacement. Following Waid\\'s run, Dan Jurgens took over and introduced new foe Protocide , a failed recipient of the Super Soldier Serum prior to the experiment that successfully created Rogers. Some time after this, Rogers\\' original shield was retrieved, but subtle damage sustained during the battle with the Beyonder resulted in it being shattered and a \\'vibranium cancer\\' being triggered that would destroy all vibranium in the world, with Rogers nearly being forced to destroy the shield before a confrontation with the villain Klaw saw Klaw\\'s attacks unwittingly repair the shield\\'s fractured molecular bonds and negate cancer. [117]   21st century [ edit ]  2000s [ edit ]  In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks , Rogers reveals his identity to the world and establishes a residence in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn , New York , as seen in Captain America vol. 4, #1–7 (June 2002 – Feb. 2003). [118] Following the disbandment of the Avengers in the \" Avengers Disassembled \" story arc, Rogers, now employed by S.H.I.E.L.D. , discovers Bucky is alive, having been saved and deployed by the Soviets as the Winter Soldier . Rogers resumes his on-again, off-again relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter . After a mass supervillain break-out of the Raft, Rogers and Tony Stark assemble a new team of Avengers to hunt the escapees. In the 2006–2007 company-wide story arc \" Civil War \", Rogers opposes the new mandatory federal registration of super-powered beings , and leads the underground anti-registration movement. After significant rancor and danger to the public as the two sides clash, Captain America voluntarily surrenders and orders the Anti-Registration forces to stand down, feeling that the fight has reached a point where the principle originally cited by the anti-registration forces has been lost. [119]  In the story arc \" The Death of Captain America \", Rogers is fatally shot by Sharon Carter, whose actions are manipulated by the villain Dr. Faustus . [120] [121] The miniseries Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America #1–5 (June–Aug. 2007) examines the reaction of the stunned superhero community to Rogers\\' assassination, with each of the five issues focusing a different character\\'s reaction. Bucky takes on the mantle of Captain America, per Rogers\\' antemortem request. [122] [123]  Captain America: Reborn #1 (Aug. 2009) reveals that Rogers did not die, as the gun Sharon Carter had been hypnotized into firing at Rogers caused his consciousness to phase in and out of space and time, appearing at various points in his lifetime. Although Rogers manages to relay a message to the future by giving a time-delayed command to the Vision during the Kree-Skrull War , the Skull returns Rogers to the present, where he takes control of Rogers\\' mind and body. Rogers eventually regains control, and, with help from his allies, defeats the Skull. [124] In the subsequent one-shot comic Captain America: Who Will Wield the Shield? , Rogers formally grants Bucky his Captain America shield and asks him to continue as Captain America. The President of the United States grants Rogers a full pardon for his anti-registration actions.  2010s [ edit ]  This article\\'s plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed .

[125]  The President of the United States appoints Rogers, in his civilian identity, as \" America\\'s top cop \" and head of the nation\\'s security, [126] replacing Norman Osborn as the tenth Executive Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. . The Superhuman Registration Act is repealed and Rogers re-establishes the superhero team the Avengers , spearheaded by Iron Man, Thor, and Bucky as Captain America. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] In the miniseries  Steve Rogers: Super Soldier , he encounters Jacob Erskine, the grandson of Professor Abraham Erskine and the son of Tyler Paxton, one of Rogers\\' fellow volunteers in the Super-Soldier program. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] Shortly afterward, Rogers becomes leader of the Secret Avengers , a black-ops superhero team. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  During the Fear Itself storyline, Steve Rogers is present when the threat of the Serpent is known. [127] Following the apparent death of Bucky at the hands of Sin (in the form of Skadi ), Steve Rogers ends up changing into his Captain America uniform. [128] When the Avengers and the New Avengers are fighting Skadi, the Serpent ends up joining the battle and breaks Captain America\\'s shield with his bare hands. [129] Captain America and the Avengers teams end up forming a militia for a last stand against the forces of the Serpent. [130] When it comes to the final battle, Captain America uses Thor\\'s hammer to fight Skadi until Thor manages to kill the Serpent. In the aftermath of the battle, Iron Man presents him with his reforged shield, now stronger for its uru-infused enhancements despite the scar it bears. [131] It is then revealed that Captain America, Nick Fury, and Black Widow are the only ones who know that Bucky actually survived the fight with Skadi as Bucky resumes his identity as Winter Soldier. [132]  During the \" Spider-Island \" storyline, Captain America had been captured turned into the Spider King by Spider Queen and Jackal . [133] He was restored to normal following his fight with Venom . [134] [135]  In the Avengers vs. X-Men story arc, Captain America attempts to apprehend Hope Summers of the X-Men . She is the targeted vessel for the Phoenix Force , a destructive cosmic entity. Captain America believes that this Phoenix Force is too dangerous to entrust in one person and seeks to prevent Hope from having it. Cyclops and the X-Men believe that the Phoenix Force will save their race, and oppose Captain America\\'s wishes. [136] The result is a series of battles that eventually take both teams to the blue area of the moon. [137] The Phoenix Force eventually possesses the five X-Men present, leaving the Avengers at an extreme disadvantage. [138] The Phoenix Five , who become corrupted by the power of the Phoenix, are eventually defeated and scattered, with Cyclops imprisoned for turning the world into a police state and murdering Charles Xavier after being pushed too far, only for him to note that, in the end, he was proven right about the Phoenix\\'s intentions. [139] From there, Captain America proceeds to assemble the Avengers Unity Squad , a new team of Avengers composed of both classic Avengers and X-Men. [140]  After Cyclops was incarcerated, and Steve accepted the Avengers should have done more to help mutants, and allowed the world to hate them, he started planning a new sub-team of Avengers in the hopes of unifying mutant and humankind alike. He chose Havok to lead his team and become the new face to represent mutants as Professor X and Cyclops once were. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Their first threat was the return of the Red Skull - more specifically, a clone of the Skull created in 1942 and kept in stasis in the event of the original\\'s death- who usurped Professor X\\'s body to provide himself with telepathic powers, which he would use to provoke citizens of New York into a mass assault against mutants, or anyone who could be one, and force the Scarlet Witch and Rogue to allow themselves to be attacked. With the help of the S-Man Honest John, he managed to even manipulate Thor . [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  The Red Skull\\'s skills were still erratic, and could not completely control Captain America, an attack against him was enough of a distraction to lose control of Rogue and the Scarlet Witch. After being overpowered by the rest of the Uncanny Avengers, the Red Skull escapes, but promises to return. In the aftermath, both Rogue and the Scarlet Witch joined the team. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  During a battle with an enemy called the Iron Nail, the Super Soldier Serum within Rogers\\'s body was neutralized, causing him to age rapidly to match his chronological age of over 90 years. [141] No longer able to take part in field missions but retaining his sharp mind, Rogers decided to take on a role as mission coordinator, organizing the Avengers\\' plans of attack from the mansion, while appointing Sam Wilson as his official \"replacement\" as Captain America. [142]  When various Avengers and X-Men were inverted into villains and several villains inverted into heroism due to a miscast spell by the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom , [143] Rogers not only coordinated the efforts of Spider-Man and the inverted villains, now called the \"Astonishing Avengers\", [144] but also donned his old armor to battle the inverted Falcon, [145] until the heroes and villains could be returned to normal with the aid of the White Skull (the inverted Red Skull). [146]  During the \" Time Runs Out \" storyline, Steve Rogers wears armor when he confronts Iron Man. The ensuing fight between the two old friends led Steve Rogers to force Iron Man to admit that he had lied to him and all of their allies, when he had known about the incursions between alternate Earths all along, but Iron Man also confessed that he wouldn\\'t change a thing. The final incursion started and Earth-1610 started approaching Earth-616 while Iron Man and Steve Rogers kept fighting. Earth-1610\\'s S.H.I.E.L.D. launched a full invasion to destroy Earth-616, where Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were crushed by a Helicarrier. [147]  As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel , Steve Rogers became the new Chief of Civilian Oversight for S.H.I.E.L.D. [148] He returned to the Uncanny Avengers where the team is now using the Schaefer Theater as their headquarters. [149]  Steve Rogers later has an encounter with an alternate Logan from Earth-807128 . After defeating Logan and bringing him to Alberta, Canada, Rogers tried to \"reassure\" Logan that this was not \"his\" past by showing him the adamantium-frozen body of Earth-616\\'s Logan. This sight reminds Logan of the need to enjoy being alive rather than brooding over the ghosts of his past. Although he told Steve Rogers what he had experienced in his timeline, Logan declined Steve\\'s offer of help. [150]   Alternate timeline Hydra duplicate [ edit ]  This article\\'s plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed . Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise.  ( January 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )  During the 2016 \" Avengers: Standoff! \" storyline, Steve Rogers learns from Rick Jones that S.H.I.E.L.D. has established Pleasant Hill, a gated community where they use Kobik to transform villains into ordinary citizens. When Rogers is brought to Pleasant Hill, he confronts Maria Hill about the Kobik project. Their argument is interrupted when Baron Helmut Zemo and Fixer restore the inmates to normal. [151] After Hill is injured, Rogers convinces Zemo to let Hill get medical attention. Rogers is then escorted to Dr. Erik Selvig \\'s clinic by Father Patrick. Selvig tells Rogers that Kobik is at the Pleasant Hill Bowling Alley. During an attempt to reason with Kobik, Rogers is attacked by Crossbones. Before Rogers can be killed, Kobik uses her abilities to restore him back to his prime. Declaring that \"It\\'s good to be back,\" Steve defeats Crossbones as Captain America and the Winter Soldier catch up with him. [152] They resume their search for Kobik, and discover that Baron Zemo had Fixer invent a device that would make Kobik subservient to them. Rogers rallies the heroes so that they can take the fight to Zemo. [153] In the aftermath of the incident, Steve and Sam plan to keep what happened at Pleasant Hill under wraps for the time being. [154]  In Captain America: Steve Rogers #1 (July 2016), the final panel apparently revealed that Rogers has been a Hydra double-agent since his early youth. [155] [156] [157] This is subsequently revealed to be the result of Kobik\\'s restoration of Rogers\\' youth, as she had been taught by the Red Skull that Hydra was good for the world, and having the mind of a four-year-old child, Kobik changed reality so that Rogers would be the greatest man he could be: believing Hydra to be good, Kobik permanently altered his memories so that Rogers believed that he had always been a member of Hydra. [158] [159] Some of Rogers\\' original heroic attributes remain intact, such as covering the death of another Hydra member within S.H.I.E.L.D., Erik Selvig , as well as knowing of Jack Flag \\'s tragic life and his immortality, which is why Steve pushes him from Zemo\\'s airplane (resulting in coma, not death). Additionally, it is revealed that Rogers\\' abusive father, Joseph, was actually killed by Hydra, and that Hydra deceived him into thinking Joseph died of a heart attack. [160] It is also revealed that Rogers witnessed his mother, Sarah, being killed by Sinclair\\'s Hydra goons and kidnapped him, which is the reason why Steve held a grudge towards Hydra\\'s evilness and plans to kill the Red Skull\\'s clone and restore Hydra\\'s lost honor. [161] As part of his long-term plans, Steve further compromised Sam Wilson\\'s current image as \\'the\\' Captain America by using his greater familiarity with the shield to deliberately put Wilson in a position where he would be unable to use the shield to save a senator from Flag-Smasher , with the final goal of demoralizing Sam to the point where he will return the shield to Rogers of his own free will, not wanting to kill Wilson and risk creating a martyr. [162]  During the 2016 \" Civil War II \" storyline, with the discovery of new Inhuman Ulysses – who has the ability to \"predict\" the future by calculating complex patterns – Rogers has set out to prevent Ulysses from learning of his true plans and allegiance. Rogers does this by \"forcing\" certain predictions on him, such as anonymously providing Bruce Banner with new gamma research to provoke a vision that would drive the Avengers to kill Banner, although this plan has apparently backfired with a recent vision showing the new Spider-Man standing over the dead Steve Rogers. [163] [164] Despite this revelation, Rogers presents himself as the voice of reason by allowing Spider-Man to flee with Thor. This inspires doubt in Tony Stark for his current stance by suggesting that he is just acting against Danvers because he does not like being top dog. [165] He then goes to Washington, D.C. , the location seen in Ulysses\\' vision, to talk to Spider-Man, who was trying to understand the vision like he was. When Captain Marvel attempts to arrest Spider-Man, Tony, wearing the War Machine armor, confronts her and the two begin to fight. [166]  Later, Rogers goes to Sokovia and joins forces with Black Widow to liberate freedom fighters from a prison so they can reclaim their country. After that, he goes to his base where Doctor Selvig expresses concern of his plan to kill the Red Skull. He then reveals that he has Baron Zemo in a cell, planning to recruit him. [167] He eventually kills the Skull after the villain is captured by the Unity Squad and the Xavier brain fragment extracted by the Beast, Rogers throwing the Skull out of a window over a cliff after Sin and Crossbones affirm their new allegiance to Rogers. [168]  In the 2017 \" Secret Empire \" storyline, Rogers, as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D, uses a subsequent alien invasion and a mass supervillain assault in order to seize control of the United States. He neutralizes the superheroes that might oppose him, [169] and seeks the Cosmic Cube to bring about a reality in which Hydra won World War II. [170] When Rick smuggles information about the Cube\\'s rewriting of Rogers\\' reality to the remaining free Avengers, a disheveled, bearded man in a torn World War II army uniform appears who introduces himself as Steve Rogers. [171] As the Avengers and Hydra search for fragments of the shattered Cube, it is revealed that this amnesic Steve Rogers is actually a manifestation of Rogers existing within the Cube itself, created by Kobik\\'s memories of Rogers before he was converted to Hydra, as she comes to recognize that her decision to \\'rewrite\\' Rogers as an agent of Hydra was wrong. [172] Although Hydra Rogers is able to mostly reassemble the Cosmic Cube, Sam Wilson and Bucky are able to use a fragment of the cube to restore the \\'memory\\' of pre-Hydra Rogers in the Cube to corporeal existence, allowing him to defeat his Hydra self, subsequently using the Cube to undo most of the damage caused by Hydra manipulating reality even if the physical damage remains. [173] \\'Hydra Cap\\' continues to exist as a separate entity and is kept trapped in a prison where he is the only inmate, mocking the restored Rogers about the challenge he will face rebuilding his reputation. For himself, Rogers muses that this troubling affair has a silver lining, that this experience will teach everyone not to place such blind trust in another. [174]   Powers and abilities [ edit ]   Steve Rogers\\' physical transformation, from a reprint of Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). Art and story by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby .  Tactician and field commander [ edit ]  Rogers\\' battle experience and training make him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander, with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle. The Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and other heroes choose Rogers as their leader during the Secret Wars ; Thor says that Rogers is one of the very few mortals he will take orders from, and follow \"through the gates of Hades\". [97]  Rogers\\' reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen. He has blended aikido , boxing , [175]  judo , [176] [177]  karate , [177] [178]  jujutsu , kickboxing , and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts. Years of practice with his near-indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy. His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a boomerang -like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind. In canon, he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the Marvel Universe, limited only by his human physique. [179] [180] Although the Super Soldier Serum is an important part of his strength, Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents, even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his pre-Captain America physique. [181]  Stan Lee claimed that he\\'d \"always been fascinated by the fact that, although Captain America has the least spectacular super-power of all, the mantle of leadership falls naturally upon him, as though he was born to command... Cap is one of the hardest hero characters to write, because the writer cannot use some exotic super-power to make his episodes seem colorful... All he has to serve him are his extraordinary combat skills, his shield, and his unquenchable love for freedom and justice.\" [182]  Rogers has vast U.S. military knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing, classified Defense Department operations. He is an expert in combat strategy, survival, acrobatics, parkour , military strategy, piloting, and demolitions. Despite his high profile as one of the world\\'s most popular and recognizable superheroes, Rogers has a broad understanding of the espionage community, largely through his ongoing relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D.   Super Soldier Serum [ edit ]  Steve Rogers is often considered to be the pinnacle of human potential and operates at peak physical performance due to his enhancement via the Super Soldier Serum. The Super Soldier Serum enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being. This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats, including bench pressing 1,100 pounds (500\\xa0kg) as a warm-up [183] and running a mile (1.6\\xa0km) in less than a minute (60\\xa0mph/97\\xa0km/h, nearly twice the maximum speed achieved by the best human sprinters). [184] Furthermore, his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades. He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus. [185] The secrets of creating a super-soldier were lost with the death of its creator, Dr. Abraham Erskine . [59] In the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate Erskine\\'s treatment, only to have them end in failure. Even worse, the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain America\\'s 1950s imitator and Nuke are the most notorious examples.  Weapons and equipment [ edit ]  Further information: Captain America\\'s shield  Captain America\\'s shield  Captain America has used multiple shields throughout his history, the most prevalent of which is a nigh-indestructible disc-shaped shield made from a unique combination of Vibranium , Steel alloy, and an unknown third component that has never been duplicated called Proto-Adamantium. [186] [187] The shield was cast by American metallurgist Dr. Myron MacLain , who was contracted by the U.S. government, from orders of President  Franklin D. Roosevelt , to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II. [186] This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated, although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the discovery of adamantium . [188]  Captain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon. The first instance of Captain America\\'s trademark ricocheting shield-toss occurs in Stan Lee \\'s first comics writing, the two-page text story \"Captain America Foils the Traitor\\'s Revenge\" in Captain America Comics #3 (May 1941). [15] The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time-traveling mutant superhero Cable telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures; Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol. [189]  When without his trademark shield, Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel, [190] or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix. [191] Rogers, having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes, carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm, and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease. [192] Much like his Vibranium shield, the energy shield can be thrown, including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand. [193]  Captain America\\'s uniform is made of a fire-retardant material, and he wears a lightweight, bulletproof duralumin  scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection. [58] Originally, Rogers\\' mask was a separate piece of material, but an early engagement had it dislodged, thus almost exposing his identity. To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device. Captain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the Wakanda Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.  Antagonists [ edit ]  Main article: List of Captain America enemies  Captain America has faced numerous foes in over 70 years of published adventures. Many of his recurring foes embody ideologies contrary to the American values that Captain America is shown to strive for and believes in. Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism ( Red Skull , Baron Zemo ), neo-Nazism ( Crossbones , Doctor Faustus ), technocratic fascism ( AIM , Arnim Zola ), Communism ( Aleksander Lukin ), amoral capitalism ( Roxxon Energy Corporation ), anti-patriotism ( Flag Smasher ) and international and domestic terrorism ( Hydra ).  Other versions [ edit ]  \"Captain America\" is the name of several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . The first and primary character is Steve Rogers, who was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby . Other characters have adopted the alias over the years, most notably Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson .  Steven Rogers (Revolutionary War Era) [ edit ]  Captain Steven Rogers , the 18th century Earth-616 ancestor of the World War 2 Super-Soldier serum recipient, wore a colorful costume and carried a round cast iron shield. [194]   Bob Russo, \"Scar\" Turpin, and Roscoe Simmons [ edit ]  In a time when Rogers had abandoned the Captain America identity, Bob Russo and \"Scar\" Turpin appear using the alias for an issue each, but both of them quickly abandon the identity after being injured. [195] Roscoe Simmons wears the star-spangled costume during Rogers\\' time as the Nomad I, and is given the shield by Rogers. He briefly serves as the Falcon\\'s junior partner, but is killed by the Red Skull a mere two issues after adopting the identity. [196]   Dave Rickford [ edit ]  Dave Rickford is a former special forces soldier who attained an augmentation, giving him superpowers, from Dr. Malus and the Power Broker . He becomes the new Captain America when Bucky is entangled in legal difficulties and Steve Rogers is the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. . He is kidnapped by A.I.M. and rescued by Rogers, who convinces him to drop the identity. [197]   1602 [ edit ]  The Marvel 1602  limited series presents an alternative history, Earth-311, in which a Captain America from the late 21st century is transported to the year 1602 after the Purple Man takes over the world – his enemy wanting to dispose of Rogers in such a way that there is nothing left of him in the present to inspire others – where he assumes the identity of Rojhaz a white Native American who is presumed by the Europeans to be of Welsh ancestry . His arrival causes numerous alterations in reality, causing analogues of various Marvel Universe characters to appear in the 17th century instead, speculated by Uatu to be the result of the universe attempting to generate a means of repairing the damage caused to reality. Rogers refuses to return to the future because he wants to nurture a new United States free of prejudice from its very beginnings, but the 1602 version of Nick Fury forces him to return, accompanying him on the journey. Rogers noted that in his version of the late 21st century, he was the last true superhero and was left alone fighting his own country – the United States – which had fallen under the rule of a tyrannical life-term President. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   1872 [ edit ]  1872 is a Marvel miniseries during the Secret Wars comics featuring characters in a Western-style adventure in the small boom town of Timely. A dam constructed for mining projects is diverting water away from nearby native territories, so Red Wolf attempts to blow it up. Sheriff Steve Rogers prevents the corrupt Mayor Fisk ( Kingpin ) from having him killed, in order to give him a fair trial. [198] However, as Rogers goes to help his friend Tony Stark ( Iron Man ) from being attacked, Red Wolf is taken and Rogers kills more of Fisk\\'s men, further angering the mayor. Red Wolf is denied a trial, and Fisk\\'s team of assassins, including Elektra ( Elektra ), Grizzly ( Grizzly ), Bullseye ( Bullseye ) and Otto Octavius ( Doctor Octopus ), are sent to kill them both. Sheriff Rogers, having Bullseye at gunpoint, attempts to rally the people of Timely into taking back their government, but is distracted and then shot by Bullseye, thrown into a pig pen by Fisk to die. [199]  Red Wolf, taking up the role of Sheriff, Widow Barnes ( Black Widow ), Doctor Banner ( Hulk ), Carol Danvers ( Captain Marvel ) and Tony Stark join together to get rid of the dam, as well as avenge Steve Rogers, [200] and they succeed in both with Banner sacrificing himself to blow up the dam, and Widow Barnes killing Fisk. The remaining characters become Sheriff Roger\\'s Avengers, protecting the town of Timely. [201]   Age of Ultron [ edit ]  In the Age of Ultron story wherein Ultron takes over the world, Captain America is one of the few surviving heroes. He is a shattered hero whose spirit is gone and shield is broken. [202] He and the remaining heroes are tasked with coming up with a plan to stop Ultron, which takes them to the Savage Land . [203] Captain America travels to the future with Iron Man , Nick Fury , Red Hulk , Storm and Quicksilver in an attempt to stop Ultron with the use of Doctor Doom \\'s time platform, [204] but are ambushed by Ultron drones and Captain America is decapitated. [205]   Age of X [ edit ]  In the Age of X reality, Rogers was the leader of the Avengers, here a strike team intended to hunt down mutants. Although he initially believed in his mission to contain the danger that mutants could pose to the world, an encounter with a mutant \\'nursery\\' protecting young children forced Rogers to recognize that he was on the wrong side, he and his team subsequently sacrificing themselves to stop the psychotic Hulk from launching a bioweapon at the mutant stronghold. Rogers\\' memories were \\'stored\\' by Legacy , a mutant who was able to convey his plan of using various mutants to generate force fields around the facility to cut it off from the outside world. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Amalgam Comics [ edit ]  In the Amalgam Comics universe, Captain America is combined with DC\\'s Superman to create Super-Soldier . [206] In this reality, Clark Kent is given a Super-Soldier serum created from DNA harvested from the body of a dead baby Kal-El. The serum gives him the powers of the main universe Superman.  Frozen in ice after a battle with Ultra-Metallo at the end of World War II, Super-Soldier is revived decades later and continues his fight for justice. [207]   Avataars: Covenant of the Shield [ edit ]  In Avataars: Covenant of the Shield , Earth\\'s version of Captain America is Captain Avalon . He is the leader of the Champions of the Realm and the King of Avalon .

[ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Bullet Points [ edit ]  The five-issue limited series Bullet Points , written by J. Michael Straczynski and illustrated by Tommy Lee Edwards , tells of an alternative reality in which Doctor Erskine is killed the day before implementing the Captain America program. Steve Rogers, still frail, volunteers for the \\'Iron Man\\' program, which bonds him to a robotic weapons-suit. He uses this to achieve victories against the Axis. [209] Years after the end of the war, Rogers is killed in a battle with Peter Parker , who is the Hulk of that reality. [210]   Captain America: Guardian of Freedom [ edit ]  A story told from the first-hand account of Rick Jones when sent back in time to the Second World War. Captured by Nazi troops, he is rescued by Captain America and Bucky. While initially believed to be shell-shocked, he convinces them that he is from the future when he reveals he knows their secret identities of Private Roger Stephenson (a brunette) and Bucky Barnes. When Barnes is murdered by the Red Skull, Jones takes his place as the new Bucky for a mission to stop Zemo\\'s missile. At the end, with another time jump, Jones encounters a President Stephenson who needs his help.

His mind affected by subtle incompatibilities between the two universes, he sees the Justice League as overlords who demand praise and worship in return for heroic actions. He especially gets angry at Superman , who (likewise affected) sees the Avengers as heroes who do not do enough and have let their world down.  After Cap and Batman battle to a standstill, the two team up to solve the mystery of the game. Using an inter-dimensional vehicle that allows them to reach the Grandmaster\\'s headquarters, they discover that the Avengers are fighting for Krona . Their intervention in the last battle, where Cap makes sure that Batman can get the cube so the JLA wins the game, causes the villain Krona to go mad and attack the Grandmaster. The Grandmaster causes the two universes to merge, imprisoning Krona between them.

The first appears in the 2015 Secret Wars tie-in, Giant Size Little Marvel , written and illustrated by Young.  In the Battleworld town of Marville, the mainstream superheroes are all elementary school age children, using their superpowers to engage in very destructive roughhousing.  This Captain America is still the leader of the Avengers, though their headquarters are in a tree house instead of Avengers Mansion.  As in the mainstream \" Avengers vs. X-Men \" storyline, Captain America faces off against Cyclops and the X-Men, only this time in an attempt to get two new kids on the block to join their respective group.

The real Captain America appears in 2099: Manifest Destiny and takes up the role of Thor before giving Mjolnir to Spider-Man 2099 . [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  In Secret Wars , a new version of Captain America was created by Alchemax and resides in the Battleworld domain of 2099. Roberta Mendez was forcefully subjected to take the Super-Soldier Serum by her husband, Harry and became the leader of Alchemax\\'s Avengers. Roberta and Captain America are two different personas of the same woman, with Roberta unknowing of her counterpart. She physically and mentally becomes Captain America if her trigger words, \"Avengers Assemble\", are said, and she reverts to Roberta if someone says \"Dismissed\". In the Secret Wars title, Captain America goes against Miguel Stone\\'s orders to treat the Defenders as criminals and worked with the Defenders and Avengers to stop Baron Mordo and the Dweller-In-Darkness. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Following Secret Wars , Roberta is transported to the prime Marvel Universe with hallucinations of her past life. She was a supporting character in the All-New, All-Different Marvel Spider-Man 2099 comic, where she was an employee at Parker Industries with Miguel O\\'Hara as her boss. After Roberta\\'s powers resurface again, she becomes a recurring ally for Spider-Man 2099. During the Civil War II storyline, Roberta goes back to 2099 to find her family, despite Miguel\\'s warnings. The Public Eye attempt to arrest her, until she is rescued by Ravage 2099. In the present, Miguel receives a call from Peter Parker, who tells him of a vision the Inhuman Ulysses had of the future: the death of Roberta Mendez. He goes back to 2099. [224] Roberta learns from Ravage about the Anti-Powers Act, a law outlawing superpowers. Roberta and Ravage are taken to the downtown area by Hawkeye 2099, where they meet the remaining heroes. Spider-Man convinces Doctor Strange 2099 to help him out in exchange for his help in eliminating the A.P.A. Meanwhile, the CEO of Alchemax calls on Power Pack to defeat the heroes. Upon finding Roberta, Strange takes Spider-Man downtown, while Roberta leaves to find her husband upon learning his location. Roberta finds her husband Harry, who claims that she died and that they do not have kids, and gets captured by Power Pack. After Strange reveals that the CEO of Alchemax is J. Jonah Jameson , Spider-Man rallies the heroes to launch an assault on S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ and rescue Roberta. In the process, they discover that \"Jameson\" and \"Power Pack\" are actually Skrull impostors. Spider-Man and Roberta then go back to 2016 to restore the timeline. [225] In the book\\'s ending, Roberta and Miguel\\'s son save Miguel from death and return to 2099 on New Year\\'s Eve. Thanks to Miguel\\'s sacrifice, Roberta\\'s family history is restored. [226]   In other media  Captain America 2099 (Roberta Mendez) appears in Marvel: Future Fight , as alternative costume to Captain America. [ citation needed ]  Captain America 2099 (Roberta Mendez) appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 . [ citation needed ]  Marvel Apes [ edit ]  In the Marvel Apes Universe, Captain America leads the Ape-vengers (which contain a lot of reformed supervillains). Secretly, he is a vampire along with his version of the Invaders , and plots to enter the 616 universe for sustenance. To accomplish this, he has already killed his world\\'s version of Mr. Fantastic . However, it is revealed that the vampire Captain America was really Baron Blood , who took on Cap\\'s form and increased his strength through the Super-Soldier Serum inside him. The real America was still frozen in ice up to the modern era, and helped the Gibbon , Wolverine , and Speedball fight off the vampire Namor . Afterwards, they stop Baron Blood.  This version of Captain America turns out to be nearly as brutal as his impersonator; for example he is willing to kill Spider-Monkey for the \\'crime\\' of helping innocent dimensional travelers. [227]   Marvel Mangaverse [ edit ]  In the Marvel Mangaverse reality, the original Captain America is decapitated and killed by Doctor Doom, but Carol Danvers assumes the identity. This is done mostly out of a desire of self-defense, but she is encouraged to keep it for the foreseeable future by Sharon Carter . The original Mangaverse Captain America is both the leader of the Avengers and the President of the United States. His costume gives him the power to generate and manipulate energy shields. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Marvel Zombies [ edit ]  In the 2005–2006 miniseries Marvel Zombies , and the follow-up 2007 Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness , Captain America is known as Colonel America and once served as the President of the United States . He is among the superheroes infected, along with his other fellow Avengers, by the zombified Sentry . Colonel America is responsible for infecting Spider-Man in Marvel Zombies vs. The Army Of Darkness by biting him on the shoulder. He is apparently killed by a zombie Red Skull , who rips off his left arm and scoops his exposed brains out before he himself is decapitated by a zombified Spider-Man. Zombie Ant-Man then steps on the Red Skull . As his intellect was partly retained in the remaining portion of his brain, he was transplanted into Black Panther \\'s son T\\'Channa\\'s dead body, and given a mechanical left arm. The transplant is successful, but the resulting brain damage turns Colonel America into a battle-crazed zombie leader, manageable but unable to focus on anything that is not related to war, confrontation, and battle. Colonel America (Steve Rogers/T\\'Channa) also has a role in Marvel Zombies Return , where he was transported to Earth-Z. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Marvel Zombies 3 features a zombie version called \"Captain Mexica\", who comes from an alternate universe in which the Aztec Empire in Mexico never fell.

He stays behind to aid the rebels in that reality, thus adding to the list of the dead / missing in action . The next iteration of MC2 Avengers aids him in A-Next #10-11, at the end of which he gives American Dream the shield that had belonged to that universe\\'s Captain America. Captain America and Thunderstrike return to their home universe to aid in the fight against Seth in Spider-Girl #59.

He has powerful energy manipulating abilities which manifest when America is threatened. Using that power he manages to kill a platoon of Super Soldiers and the Avengers, which consist of Black Widow, Deathlok, Typhoid Mary, Hawkeye and Iron Giant Man ( Tony Stark ). He is defeated by Havok and is then drawn below the earth by The Beyonder who kills him after he finds out what he needs to know. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. [ edit ]  Captain America is mentioned several times in Nextwave , usually by Monica Rambeau (who constantly talks about her time as an Avenger). At one point, Monica theorizes that Captain America is secretly gay, as he was the only Avenger who never hit on her (Tabitha Smith agrees that it would be cool if that were true and that it would explain why \"people always dress like him at gay pride marches\") [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  He appears in a flashback Monica has, when the Avengers are attacked by naked enemies. He tells her to \"cover your eyes, go back to the mansion, and make my dinner\". [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Old Man Logan [ edit ]  In this potential future , all the Marvel Universe superheroes were killed when the supervillains combined forces. The villains then conquer and divide up control of the United States.  Captain America is shown in a flashback as having been killed by the Red Skull in the ruins of the U.S. Capitol . The Red Skull subsequently takes Cap\\'s costume and wears it as President of America . [228]   Peggy Carter [ edit ]  In an alternate universe where World War II is still raging, Steve Rogers and Professor Erskine are both assassinated before the Super-Soldier Serum is administered, so Peggy Carter steps up to participate in Project: Rebirth.  Although British, she takes up the shield and American flag to fight as Captain America.  In this universe, Becky Barnes serves alongside Captain Peggy. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  The concept of Peggy Carter serving as Captain America was created for the game Marvel Puzzle Quest for Captain America\\'s 75th anniversary.  She was adapted into the third series of the comic Exiles . [229]  Peggy Carter also appears as a version of Captain America (named Captain Britain) in the first episode of the Marvel Studios animated series What If...? In this version, Peggy takes the Super-Soldier Serum, while Steve Rogers later joins the fight with an armored suit built by Howard Stark and becomes Iron Man. [230]   Ruins [ edit ]  Warren Ellis \\'s Ruins limited series explored a version of the Marvel Universe where \"everything went wrong\". In this continuity, Captain America himself makes no physical appearance in the series aside from the cover for issue #1 and in a dream sequence in issue #2. He was a member of the Avengers, a revolutionary cell formed by Tony Stark bent on liberating California from the corrupt rule of President Charles Xavier, but along with many other members of the team, he is killed aboard the Avengers Quinjet. His shield is recovered by soldiers who celebrate the deaths of the Avengers. A part of the Captain\\'s war history is touched upon by the now-psychotic Nick Fury, who was ordered to destroy the Quinjet by the President: \"...I\\'ll give you an anecdote. Back in the war, it was America introduced me to eating human meat.\" [231]   Spider-Gwen [ edit ]  Captain America is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent on Earth-65 , who apprehends Spider-Gwen during her battle with the Lizard (this reality\\'s Peter Parker). This Captain America is an African American woman named Samantha Wilson a genderbent version of Sam Wilson/Falcon . [232] During the 1940s, Samantha volunteered for Project: Rebirth after other test subjects were shot and killed or badly injured by Nazis. She became trapped in an alternate dimension after seemingly sacrificing herself to stop Arnim Zola , but later managed to return home to find that 75 years had passed. [233] Steve Rogers would go on to become a famous comic creator, who writes stories of Samantha\\'s dimensional journeys that he saw in his dreams, which Sam confirmed as being accurate. [234]   Spider-Island [ edit ]  In this retelling of Spider-Island as part of the \" Secret Wars \" storyline, Captain America and the other heroes are mutated into monster spiders and he is still the Spider Queen\\'s \"Spider King\" in the Battleworld domain of Spider-Island. However, Agent Venom gives Captain America the Godstone and turns him into a Man-Wolf (as an homage to the time when Captain America was a werewolf called Capwolf), releasing Steve from the Spider Queen\\'s control. He uses his new form to fight for the resistance. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Spider-Man: Life Story [ edit ]  Spider-Man: Life Story takes place in an alternate continuity where characters naturally age after Peter Parker debuts as Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Captain America is pressured by the public to join the efforts in Vietnam and decides to go to see the conflict for himself. A year later, American soldiers label Steve as a traitor when he decides to protect a Vietnamese village. Captain America also gets himself involved in the Superhuman Civil War in the 2000s. In the 2010s, it is unknown if he is dead or in hiding after Doctor Doom took over the planet. [235]   Truth: Red, White & Black [ edit ]  Main article: Truth: Red, White & Black  In the 2003  limited series  Truth: Red, White & Black , black soldiers act as test subjects for the WWII Super-Soldier program of 1942. Most of the subjects die, or become deformed with the exception of one, Isaiah Bradley . Isaiah substitutes for Captain America on an assignment, discovering Jewish concentration camp detainees subjected to experiments. [236]  In Captain America (vol. 4) #28 (August 2004), an Isaiah Bradley from an alternative Earth became Captain America and never married. Later, he is elected president and serves two terms. He travels back in time, accidentally crossing to Earth-616 , and brings the mainstream Captain America and Rebecca Quan forward into his own time to prevent his daughter, Rebecca \"Becky\" Barnes, from traveling to Earth-616. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Ultimate Marvel [ edit ]  Main article: Ultimate Captain America  In addition to the WWII era hero, a 1960s version of Captain America (a.k.a. \"Captain America of the Vietnam War\") exists as an Ultimate Marvel Universe parallel to the William Burnside/Captain America of the 1950s , who succeeded Rogers in the role after he is accidentally frozen. The 1960s Captain America is in fact Frank Simpson, better known in the Earth-616 Marvel Universe as Nuke . As scientists were unable to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum, they used cybernetics and steroids to enhance Simpson, which eventually eroded his sanity. [237]   Scott Summers [ edit ]  In an alternate future of the Ultimate Universe , Scott Summers assumes the mantle of Captain America after Steve Rogers dies and leads a small team of X-Men to fight for mutant justice. [238]   Weapon X: Days of Future Now [ edit ]  Steve Rogers is selected for the Weapon X program. He is given a procedure similar to Wolverine\\'s that bonds vibranium to his skeleton. He is given the code name Vibram. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   What If? [ edit ]  Alternative versions of Steve Rogers are seen within several issues of the What If? series.  In \"What If Captain America and Bucky Had Both Survived World War Two?\", Steve is able to hold onto the drone plane and deactivate the bomb, allowing both men to survive. Baron Zemo is shot by the Red Skull for failing to kill Captain America and Bucky, but it is later revealed that the Skull shot him with a weapon which put him to sleep for 20 years. Bucky and Cap continue to fight in the 1950s and 1960s against Communists, though tragically Nick Fury is killed in the Korean War.  In the mid-1960s, Bucky goes his own way. Contacted by President Lyndon Johnson , the aged Steve is offered the job as the head of the newly created S.H.I.E.L.D. , but Steve declines and suggests Barnes instead.  S.H.I.E.L.D. and Barnes battle HYDRA, but fail to capture the Supreme Hydra. Joining Steve on one of his missions, the pair run into the Hulk and Rick Jones. Steve is knocked out, forcing Bucky to use Cap\\'s shield and rescue Rick from the Hulk\\'s rampage. Bucky decides to take on the role of Captain America, to which Steve agrees. Overhearing the conversation, Rick light-heartedly blackmails the two for the chance to be the new Bucky. Steve becomes the new leader of S.H.I.E.L.D..  Tracking the final group of HYDRA to an uncharted island, Steve and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter team up with the new Cap and Bucky. The group infiltrate the island\\'s volcano, which turns out to be fake and created as a hideaway for HYDRA forces.  The four are captured, and the Supreme Hydra is revealed to be Baron Zemo, who has not aged for 20 years due to the Red Skull\\'s weapon. Believing that Captain America is still Rogers, he prepares to kill Bucky, but Steve escapes his cuffs and frees the others. A fierce battle ensues, resulting in Zemo\\'s death, but not before a shot from Zemo\\'s gun hits and kills Bucky. The story ends with a distraught Steve mourning the loss of his friend, and the possibility of Rick Jones becoming the new Captain America. [239]  \"What If...Captain America Fought in the Civil War?\" features a continuum where Captain America lived during the American Civil War . In this universe, Steve Rogers is a corporal attached to a Northern regiment called the Redlegs , led by Colonel Buck \"Bucky\" Barnes. Rogers\\'s first mission turns out to be an attack on a group of civilians, and he refuses to follow Barnes\\' orders.  Barnes shoots Rogers, but only wounds him after Barnes is attacked by an eagle.  Rogers passes out while trying to escape, and has visions of We-pi-ahk the Eagle-Chief.  Waking, he is greeted by a black man, Private Wilson , who brought him back to an Indian reserve. Wilson believes Steve\\'s vision of We-pi-ahk means he is destined to be the one that will bring union to all people. Wilson begins a mystical ceremony that he says will make Rogers \"as you are on the inside, so shall you become on the outside.\"  Barnes breaks into the hut as the ceremony is underway.  Rogers is mystically given superhuman strength and a magical shield that can transform into an eagle, while Barnes\\' head is turned into a fleshless skull.  Barnes orders his men to open fire and kill everyone in the camp, and Wilson is fatally shot.  Before the troops can escape, Rogers appears as Captain America, and captures Barnes and his men.  Thanks to Captain America\\'s involvement, the Civil War ends earlier than in our history, and Abraham Lincoln is never assassinated.  Rogers helps the South rebuild after the war, and suppresses the rise of the K.K.K. As a representative of the Indian people, he is able to prevent the Indian wars of 1870. Unfortunately Barnes, now known as the White Skull, forms a group even more dangerous than the K.K.K. The descendants of both men continue fighting each other up to the present in this alternative universe.

There are many rumors about the origin of the mysterious Civil Warrior… legend says he is a Captain America from an alternate Earth ravaged by the Civil War between his own army and Iron Man’s forces. On that world, the two heroes mortally wounded each other in the final battle of the war; Steve survived, but Tony didn’t. Riddled with guilt for the battle’s destruction and the death of his former ally at his own hands, he assumed the mantle of the Civil Warrior. Adding Tony’s ARC technology to his Captain America gear, he vowed to use his friend’s legacy to stop this senseless conflict from ever happening again.   ^  U.S.Avengers #1 (January 2017)   ^  Univers X: Cap No 1, 2001   ^  Batman and Captain America (Dec. 1996)   ^  Exiles #9   ^  Exiles #31-32   ^  JLA/Avengers #1 and #3 (Sept. and Dec. 2003) and Avengers/JLA #2 and #4 (Oct. 2003 and March 2004)   ^  Captain America Corps #1-5   ^  The Last Avengers Story #1 & 2 (Nov & Dec 1995)   ^  \"Larval Earth\" .

       " 'Steve Ditko': 'American comic-book artist    Steve Ditko Born ( 1927-11-02 ) November 2, 1927 Johnstown, Pennsylvania , U.S. Died c. June 27, 2018 (aged 90) New York City , New York , U.S. Nationality American Area(s) Writer, Penciller , Inker Notable works Spider-Man Doctor Strange Creeper Hawk and Dove Mr. A Question Captain Atom Blue Beetle  Stephen J. Ditko [1] ( / ˈ d ɪ t k oʊ / ; November 2, 1927 – c. June 29, 2018) was an American comics artist and writer best known as the artist and co-creator, with Stan Lee , of the Marvel Comics superheroes Spider-Man and Doctor Strange . Ditko studied under Batman artist Jerry Robinson at the Cartoonist and Illustrators School in New York City. He began his professional career in 1953, working in the studio of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby , beginning as an inker and coming under the influence of artist Mort Meskin . During this time, he then began his long association with Charlton Comics , where he did work in the genres of science fiction, horror, and mystery. He also co-created the superhero  Captain Atom in 1960. During the 1950s, Ditko also drew for Atlas Comics , a forerunner of Marvel Comics. He went on to contribute much significant work to Marvel. In 1966, after being the exclusive artist on The Amazing Spider-Man and the \"Doctor Strange\" feature in Strange Tales , Ditko left Marvel for unclear reasons. Ditko continued to work for Charlton and also DC Comics , including a revamp of the long-running character the Blue Beetle , and creating or co-creating the Question , the Creeper , Shade the Changing Man , and Hawk and Dove . Ditko also began contributing to small independent publishers, where he created Mr. A , a hero reflecting the influence of Ayn Rand \\'s philosophy of Objectivism . Ditko largely declined to give interviews, saying he preferred to communicate through his work. Ditko was inducted into the comics industry\\'s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990, and into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994.

The second-oldest child in a working-class family, he was preceded by sister Anna Marie, [4] and followed by sister Elizabeth and brother Patrick. [1] Inspired by his father\\'s love of newspaper comic strips , particularly Hal Foster \\'s Prince Valiant , Ditko found his interest in comics accelerated by the introduction of the superhero  Batman in 1939, and by Will Eisner \\'s The Spirit , which appeared in a tabloid -sized comic-book insert in Sunday newspapers. [5]  Ditko in junior high school was part of a group of students who crafted wooden models of German airplanes to aid civilian World War II aircraft-spotters. [5] Upon graduating from Greater Johnstown High School in 1945, [5] he enlisted in the U.S. Army on October 26, 1945, [4] and did military service in Allied-occupied Germany , where he drew comics for an Army newspaper. [5]   Career [ edit ]   The Thing #12 (Feb. 1954), Ditko\\'s first published comic-book cover  Following his discharge, Ditko learned that his idol, Batman artist Jerry Robinson , was teaching at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (later the School of Visual Arts ) in New York City. Moving there in 1950, he enrolled in the art school under the G.I. Bill . [6] Robinson found the young student \"a very hard worker who really focused on his drawing\" [7] and someone who \"could work well with other writers as well as write his own stories and create his own characters\", [7] and he helped Ditko acquire a scholarship for the following year. [8] \"He was in my class for two years, four or five days a week, five hours a night. It was very intense.\" [9] Robinson, who invited artists and editors to speak with his class, once brought in Stan Lee , then editor of Marvel Comics \\' 1950s precursor Atlas Comics and, \"I think that was when Stan first saw Steve\\'s work.\" [9]  Ditko began professionally illustrating comic books in early 1953, drawing writer Bruce Hamilton\\'s science-fiction story \"Stretching Things\" for the Key Publications imprint Stanmor Publications , which sold the story to Ajax/Farrell , where it finally found publication in Fantastic Fears #5 ( cover-dated Feb. 1954). [10] [11] Ditko\\'s first published work was his second professional story, the six-page \"Paper Romance\" in Daring Love #1 (Oct. 1953), [10] published by the Key imprint Gillmor Magazines . [12]  Shortly afterward, Ditko found work at the studio of writer-artists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby , who had created Captain America and other characters. Beginning as an inker on backgrounds, Ditko was soon working with and learning from Mort Meskin , an artist whose work he had long admired. \"Meskin was fabulous,\" Ditko once recalled. \"I couldn\\'t believe the ease with which he drew: strong compositions, loose pencils, yet complete; detail without clutter. I loved his stuff\". [13] Ditko\\'s known assistant work includes aiding inker Meskin on the Jack Kirby pencil work of Harvey Comics \\' Captain 3-D #1 (Dec. 1953). [14] For his own third published story, Ditko penciled and inked the six-page \"A Hole in His Head\" in Black Magic vol. 4, #3 (Dec. 1953), published by Simon & Kirby\\'s Crestwood Publications imprint Prize Comics . [15]  Ditko then began a long association with the Derby, Connecticut publisher Charlton Comics , a low-budget division of a company best known for song-lyric magazines. Beginning with the cover of The Thing! #12 (Feb. 1954) and the eight-page vampire story \"Cinderella\" in that issue, Ditko would continue to work intermittently for Charlton until the company\\'s demise in 1986, producing science fiction, horror and mystery stories, as well as co-creating Captain Atom , with writer Joe Gill , in Space Adventures #33 (March 1960). [16] He first went on hiatus from the company, and comics altogether, in mid-1954, when he contracted tuberculosis and returned to his parents\\' home in Johnstown to recuperate. [17]   Marvel Comics [ edit ]  After he recovered and moved back to New York City in late 1955, [17] Ditko began drawing for Atlas Comics , the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics , beginning with the four-page \"There\\'ll Be Some Changes Made\" in Journey into Mystery #33 (April 1956); this debut tale would be reprinted in Marvel\\'s Curse of the Weird #4 (March 1994). Ditko would go on to contribute a large number of stories, many considered classic, to Atlas/Marvel\\'s Strange Tales and the newly launched Amazing Adventures , Strange Worlds , Tales of Suspense and Tales to Astonish , issues of which would typically open with a Kirby-drawn monster story, followed by one or two twist-ending thrillers or sci-fi tales drawn by Don Heck , Paul Reinman , or Joe Sinnott , all capped by an often-surreal, sometimes self-reflexive short by Ditko and writer-editor Stan Lee . [18]  These Lee-Ditko short stories proved so popular that Amazing Adventures was reformatted to feature such stories exclusively beginning with issue #7 (Dec. 1961), when the comic was rechristened Amazing Adult Fantasy , a name intended to reflect its more \"sophisticated\" nature, as likewise the new tagline \"The magazine that respects your intelligence\". Lee in 2009 described these \"short, five-page filler strips that Steve and I did together\", originally \"placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill\", as \"odd fantasy tales that I\\'d dream up with O. Henry -type endings.\" Giving an early example of what would later be known as the \" Marvel Method \" of writer-artist collaboration, Lee said, \"All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and he\\'d be off and running. He\\'d take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect.\" [19]   Creation of Spider-Man [ edit ]  After Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee obtained permission from publisher Martin Goodman to create a new \"ordinary teen\" superhero named \"Spider-Man\", [20] Lee originally approached his leading artist, Jack Kirby . Kirby told Lee about his own 1950s character conception, variously called the Silver Spider and Spiderman, in which an orphaned boy finds a magic ring that gives him super powers. Comics historian Greg Theakston says Lee and Kirby \"immediately sat down for a story conference\" and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. \"A day or two later\", Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, and, as Lee recalled, \"I hated the way he was doing it. Not that he did it badly\\xa0— it just wasn\\'t the character I wanted; it was too heroic\". [21]  Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual motif Lee found satisfactory, [22] although Lee would later replace Ditko\\'s original cover with one penciled by Kirby. Ditko said, \"The Spider-Man pages Stan showed me were nothing like the (eventually) published character. In fact, the only drawings of Spider-Man were on the splash [ i.e. , page 1] and at the end [where] Kirby had the guy leaping at you with a web gun... Anyway, the first five pages took place in the home, and the kid finds a ring and turns into Spider-Man.\" [23]  Ditko also recalled that, \"One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn\\'t have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn\\'t sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character\\'s face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....\" [24]  Much earlier, in a rare contemporaneous account, Ditko described his and Lee\\'s contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): \"Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal\". He added he would continue drawing Spider-Man \"[i]f nothing better comes along.\" [25] That same year, he expressed to the fanzine Voice of Comicdom , regarding a poll of \"Best Liked\" fan-created comics, \"It seems a shame, since comics themselves have so little variety of stories and styles that you would deliberately restrict your own creative efforts to professional comics[\\'] shallow range. What is \\'Best Liked\\' by most readers is what they are most familiar in seeing and any policy based on readers likes has to end up with a lot of look-a-like ( sic ) strips. You have a great opportunity to show everyone a whole new range of ideas, unlimited types of stories and styles—why FLUB it!\" [26]  From 1958 to 1968, [27] Ditko shared a Manhattan studio at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton , an art-school classmate. When either artist was under deadline pressure, it was not uncommon for them to pitch in and help the other with his assignment. [28] [29] Ditko biographer Blake Bell, without citing sources, said, \"At one time in history, Ditko denied ever touching Stanton\\'s work, even though Stanton himself said they would each dabble in each other\\'s art; mainly spot-inking\", [28] and the introduction to one book of Stanton\\'s work says, \"Eric Stanton drew his pictures in India ink , and they were then hand-coloured by Ditko\". [30] In a 1988 interview with Theakston, Stanton recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was \"almost nil\", he and Ditko had \"worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands\". [31]  Spider-Man debuted in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962), the final issue of that science-fiction/fantasy anthology series. When the issue proved to be a top seller, Spider-Man was given his own series, The Amazing Spider-Man . [32] [33] Lee and Ditko\\'s collaboration on the series saw the creation of many of the character\\'s best known antagonists including Doctor Octopus in issue #3 (July 1963); [34] the Sandman in #4 (Sept. 1963); [35] the Lizard in #6 (Nov. 1963); [36]  Electro in #9 (March 1964); [37] and the Green Goblin in #14 (July 1964). [38] Ditko eventually desired credit for the plotting he was contributing under the Marvel Method . Lee concurred, and starting with #25 (June 1965), Ditko received plot credit for the stories. [39]  One of the most celebrated issues of the Lee-Ditko run is #33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc \" If This Be My Destiny...! \", and featuring the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery. Comics historian Les Daniels noted, \"Steve Ditko squeezes every ounce of anguish out of Spider-Man\\'s predicament, complete with visions of the uncle he failed and the aunt he has sworn to save.\" [40]  Peter David observed, \"After his origin, this two-page sequence from Amazing Spider-Man #33 is perhaps the best-loved sequence from the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era.\" [41] Steve Saffel stated the \"full page Ditko image from The Amazing Spider-Man #33 is one of the most powerful ever to appear in the series and influenced writers and artists for many years to come.\" [42] Matthew K. Manning wrote that \"Ditko\\'s illustrations for the first few pages of this Lee story included what would become one of the most iconic scenes in Spider-Man\\'s history.\" [43] The story was chosen as #15 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel\\'s readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story, \"These first five pages are a modern-day equivalent to Shakespeare as Parker\\'s soliloquy sets the stage for his next action. And with dramatic pacing and storytelling, Ditko delivers one of the great sequences in all comics.\" [44]   Doctor Strange and other characters [ edit ]   Dormammu attacks Eternity in a Ditko \"Dr. Strange\" panel from Strange Tales #146 (July 1966).  Ditko created [45] [46] the supernatural hero Doctor Strange in Strange Tales #110 (July 1963). [47] Ditko in the 2000s told a visiting fan that Lee gave Dr. Strange the first name \"Stephen\". [48]  Though often overshadowed by his Spider-Man work, Ditko\\'s Doctor Strange artwork has been equally acclaimed for its surrealistic mystical landscapes and increasingly psychedelic visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students. \"People who read \\'Doctor Strange\\' thought people at Marvel must be heads [i.e. drug users],\" recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer Roy Thomas in 1971, \"because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms . But ... I don\\'t use hallucinogens, nor do I think any artists do.\" [49]  Eventually Lee & Ditko would take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In an epic 17-issue story arc in Strange Tales #130–146 (March 1965 – July 1966), Lee and Ditko introduced the cosmic character Eternity , who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos. [50] As historian Bradford W. Wright describes,  .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} Steve Ditko contributed some of his most surrealistic work to the comic book and gave it a disorienting, hallucinogenic quality. Dr. Strange\\'s adventures take place in bizarre worlds and twisting dimensions that resembled Salvador Dalí paintings.  ... Inspired by the pulp-fiction magicians of Stan Lee\\'s childhood as well as by contemporary Beat culture. Dr. Strange remarkably predicted the youth counterculture \\'s fascination with Eastern mysticism and psychedelia . Never among Marvel\\'s more popular or accessible characters, Dr. Strange still found a niche among an audience seeking a challenging alternative to more conventional superhero fare. [51] The cartoonist and fine artist  Seth in 2003 described Ditko\\'s style as: ...oddball for mainstream comics. Whereas Kirby\\'s stuff clearly appealed to a boy\\'s sensibility because there was so much raw power, Ditko\\'s work was really delicate and cartoony. There was a sense of design to it. You can always recognize anything that Ditko designed because it\\'s always flowery. There is a lot of embroidered detail in the art, which is almost psychedelic. [52]  In addition to Dr. Strange, Ditko in the 1960s also drew comics starring the Hulk and Iron Man. He penciled and inked the final issue of The Incredible Hulk (#6, March 1963), then continued to collaborate with writer-editor Lee on a relaunched Hulk feature in the omnibus Tales to Astonish , beginning with issue #60 (Oct. 1964). Ditko, inked by George Roussos , penciled the feature through #67 (May 1965). Ditko designed the Hulk\\'s primary antagonist, the Leader , in #63 (Jan. 1965). Ditko also penciled the Iron Man feature in Tales of Suspense #47–49 (Nov. 1963 – Jan. 1964), with various inkers. The first of these debuted the initial version of Iron Man\\'s modern red-and-golden armor, though whether Ditko or cover-penciler and principal character designer Jack Kirby designed the costume is uncertain. Whichever feature he drew, Ditko\\'s idiosyncratic, cleanly detailed, instantly recognizable art style, emphasizing mood and anxiety , found great favor with readers. The character of Spider-Man and his troubled personal life meshed well with Ditko\\'s own interests, which Lee eventually acknowledged by giving the artist plotting credits on the latter part of their 38-issue run. But after four years on the title, Ditko left Marvel; [53] he and Lee had not been on speaking terms for some time, with art and editorial changes handled through intermediaries. [54] The details of the rift remain uncertain, even to Lee, who confessed in 2003, \"I never really knew Steve on a personal level.\" [54] Ditko later claimed it was Lee who broke off contact and disputed the long-held belief [55] that the disagreement was over the true identity of the Green Goblin : \"Stan never knew what he was getting in my Spider-Man stories and covers until after [production manager] Sol Brodsky took the material from me ... so there couldn\\'t have been any disagreement or agreement, no exchanges ... no problems between us concerning the Green Goblin or anything else from before issue #25 to my final issues\". [56] Spider-Man successor artist John Romita , in a 2010 deposition , recalled that Lee and Ditko \"ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters. ...\" [57] A friendly farewell was given to Ditko in the \" Bullpen Bulletins \" of comics cover-dated July 1966, including Fantastic Four #52: \"Steve recently told us he was leaving for personal reasons. After all these years, we\\'re sorry to see him go, and we wish the talented guy success with his future endeavors.\" [58]  Regardless, said Lee in 2007, \"Quite a few years ago I met him up at the Marvel offices when I was last in New York. And we spoke; he\\'s a hell of a nice guy and it was very pleasant. ... I haven\\'t heard from him since that meeting.\" [59]   Charlton and DC Comics [ edit ]  Back at Charlton—where the page rate was low but creators were allowed greater freedom—Ditko worked on such characters as the Blue Beetle (1967–1968), [60] the Question (1967–1968), and Captain Atom (1965–1967), returning to the character he had co-created in 1960. In addition, in 1966 and 1967, he drew 16 stories, most of them written by Archie Goodwin , for Warren Publishing \\'s horror-comic magazines Creepy and Eerie , generally using an ink-wash technique. [61]  In 1967, Ditko gave his Objectivist ideas ultimate expression in the form of Mr. A , published in Wally Wood \\'s independent title witzend #\\xa03. Ditko\\'s hard line against criminals was controversial [ citation needed ] and he continued to produce Mr. A stories and one-pagers until the end of the 1970s. [ citation needed ] Ditko returned to Mr. A in 2000 and in 2009. [ citation needed ]    A panoply of Ditko DC Comics characters, from a \"DC Profiles\" biographical page appearing in comics cover-dated April 1980, including Batman #322 and The Legion of Super-Heroes #262. From left: the Creeper ; Hawk and Dove ; Stalker ; the Odd Man ; Shade, the Changing Man ; Starman .  Ditko moved to DC Comics in 1968, where he co-created the Creeper in Showcase #73 (April 1968) with Don Segall , under editor Murray Boltinoff . [62] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that Ditko\\'s art on the Creeper stories made \"them look unlike anything else being published by DC at the time.\" [63] Ditko co-created the team Hawk and Dove in Showcase #75 (June 1968), with writer Steve Skeates . [64] Around this time, he penciled the lead story, written and inked by Wally Wood, in Wood\\'s early mature-audience, independent-comics publication Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon (1969). [65]  Ditko\\'s stay at DC was short—he would work on all six issues of the Creeper\\'s own title, Beware the Creeper (June 1968 – April 1969), though leaving midway through the final one—and the reasons for his departure uncertain. But while at DC, Ditko recommended Charlton staffer Dick Giordano to the company, [66] who would go on to become a top DC penciller, inker, editor, and ultimately, in 1981, the managing editor. From this time up through the mid-1970s, Ditko worked exclusively for Charlton and various small press/independent publishers. Frank McLaughlin , Charlton\\'s art director during this period, describes Ditko as living \"in a local hotel in Derby for a while. He was a very happy-go-lucky guy with a great sense of humor at that time, and always supplied the [female] color separators with candy and other little gifts\". [67]  For Charlton in 1974 he did Liberty Belle backup stories in E-Man and conceived Killjoy . Ditko produced much work for Charlton\\'s science-fiction and horror titles, as well as for former Marvel publisher Martin Goodman \\'s start-up line Atlas/Seaboard Comics , where he co-created the superhero the Destructor with writer Archie Goodwin, and penciled all four issues of the namesake series (Feb.–Aug. 1975), the first two of which were inked by Wally Wood. Ditko worked on the second and third issues of Tiger-Man and the third issue of Morlock 2001 , with Bernie Wrightson inking. [65]   Later-day Ditko [ edit ]  Ditko returned to DC Comics in 1975, creating a short-lived title, Shade, the Changing Man (1977–1978). [65] [68] Shade was later revived, without Ditko\\'s involvement, in DC\\'s mature-audience imprint Vertigo . With writer Paul Levitz , he co-created the four-issue sword and sorcery series Stalker (1975–1976). [69] [70] Ditko and writer Gerry Conway produced the first issue of a two-issue Man-Bat series. [71] He also revived the Creeper [72] and did such various other jobs as a short Demon backup series in 1979 and stories in DC\\'s horror and science-fiction anthologies. Editor Jack C. Harris hired Ditko as guest artist on several issues of The Legion of Super-Heroes , a decision which garnered a mixed reaction from the title\\'s readership. [73] Ditko also drew the Prince Gavyn version of Starman in Adventure Comics #467–478 (1980). [65] [74] He then decamped to do work for a variety of publishers, briefly contributing to DC again in the mid-1980s, with four pinups of his characters for Who\\'s Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe and a pinup for Superman #400 (Oct. 1984) [75] [76] and its companion portfolio. [77]  Ditko returned to Marvel in 1979, taking over Jack Kirby\\'s Machine Man , [78] drawing The Micronauts [79] and Captain Universe , and continuing to freelance for the company into the late 1990s. Starting in 1984, he penciled the last two years of the space-robot series Rom . A Godzilla story by Ditko and Marv Wolfman was changed into a Dragon Lord story published in Marvel Spotlight . [80] [81] Ditko and writer Tom DeFalco introduced the Speedball character in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #22 (1988) [82] and Ditko drew a ten-issue series based on the character. In 1982, he also began freelancing for the early independent comics label Pacific Comics , beginning with Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers #6 (Sept. 1982), in which he introduced the superhero Missing Man, with Mark Evanier scripting to Ditko\\'s plot and art. Subsequent Missing Man stories appeared in Pacific Presents #1–3 (Oct. 1982 – March 1984), with Ditko scripting the former and collaborating with longtime friend Robin Snyder on the script for the latter two. Ditko also created The Mocker for Pacific, in Silver Star #2 (April 1983). [65]  For Eclipse Comics , he contributed a story featuring his character Static (no relation to the later Milestone Comics character) in Eclipse Monthly #1–3 (Aug.–Oct. 1983), introducing supervillain the Exploder in #2. With writer Jack C. Harris, Ditko drew the backup feature \"The Faceless Ones\" in First Comics \\' Warp #2–4 (April–June 1983). Working with that same writer and others, Ditko drew a handful of the Fly , Flygirl and Jaguar stories for The Fly #2–8 (July 1983 – Aug. 1984), for Archie Comics \\' short-lived 1980s superhero line; in a rare latter-day instance of Ditko inking another artist, he inked penciler  Dick Ayers on the Jaguar story in The Fly #9 (Oct. 1984). [65]  Western Publishing in 1982 announced a series by Ditko and Harris would appear in a new science-fiction comic, Astral Frontiers , but that title never materialized. [83]  In the early 1990s Ditko worked for Jim Shooter\\'s newly founded company Valiant Comics , drawing, among others, issues of Magnus, Robot Fighter , Solar, Man of the Atom and X-O-Manowar . In 1992 Ditko worked with writer Will Murray to produce one of his last original characters for Marvel Comics, the superheroine Squirrel Girl , who debuted in Marvel Super-Heroes vol. 2, #8, a.k.a. Marvel Super-Heroes Winter Special (Jan. 1992). [84]  In 1993, he did the Dark Horse Comics  one-shot  The Safest Place in the World . For the Defiant Comics series Dark Dominion , he drew issue #0, which was released as a set of trading cards . In 1995, he pencilled a four-issue series for Marvel based on the Phantom 2040 animated TV series. This included a poster that was inked by John Romita Sr.  Steve Ditko\\'s Strange Avenging Tales was announced as a quarterly series from Fantagraphics Books , although it only ran one issue (Feb. 1997) due to publicly unspecified disagreements between Ditko and the publisher. [85]  The New York Times assessed in 2008 that, \"By the \\'70s he was regarded as a slightly old-fashioned odd-ball; by the \\'80s he was a commercial has-been, picking up wretched work-for-hire gigs. ...following the example of [Ayn] Rand\\'s John Galt, Ditko hacked out moneymaking work, saving his care for the crabbed Objectivist screeds he published with tiny presses. And boy, could Ditko hack: seeing samples of his Transformers coloring book and his Big Boy comic is like hearing Orson Welles sell frozen peas.\" [86]  Ditko retired from mainstream comics in 1998. [87] His later work for Marvel and DC included such established superheroes as the Sub-Mariner (in Marvel Comics Presents ) and newer, licensed characters such as the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers . The last mainstream character he created was Marvel\\'s Longarm in Shadows & Light #1 (Feb. 1998), in a self-inked, 12-page Iron Man story \"A Man\\'s Reach....\", scripted by Len Wein . His final mainstream work was a five-page New Gods story for DC Comics, \"Infinitely Gentle Infinitely Suffering\", inked by Mick Gray and believed to be intended for the 2000–2002 Orion series [88] but not published until the 2008 trade paperback  Tales of the New Gods . [88]  Thereafter, Ditko\\'s solo work was published intermittently by Robin Snyder, who was his editor at Charlton, Archie Comics, and Renegade Press in the 1980s. The Snyder publications have included a number of original books as well as reprints such as Static , The Missing Man , The Mocker and, in 2002, Avenging World , a collection of stories and essays spanning 30 years. [65]  In 2008, Ditko and Snyder released The Avenging Mind , a 32-page essay publication featuring several pages of new artwork; and Ditko, Etc... , a 32-page comic book composed of brief vignettes and editorial cartoons. Releases have continued in that format, with stories introducing such characters as the Hero, Miss Eerie, the Cape, the Madman, the Grey Negotiator, the\\xa0!? and the Outline. [89] He said in 2012 of his self-published efforts, \"I do those because that\\'s all they\\'ll let me do.\" [90]  In addition to the new material, Ditko and Snyder reprinted earlier Ditko material. In 2010 they published a new edition of the 1973 Mr. A comic and a selection of Ditko covers in The Cover Series . In 2011 they published a new edition of the 1975 comic ...Wha...!? Ditko\\'s H. Series . [65]  Two \"lost\" stories drawn by Ditko in 1978 have been published by DC in hardcover collections of the artist\\'s work. A Creeper story scheduled for the never published Showcase #106 appears in The Creeper by Steve Ditko (2010) [91] and an unpublished Shade, the Changing Man story appears in The Steve Ditko Omnibus Vol. 1 (2011). [92] A Hulk and the Human Torch story written by Jack C. Harris and drawn by Ditko in the 1980s was published by Marvel as Incredible Hulk and the Human Torch: From the Marvel Vault #1 in August 2011. [93]   Personal life and death [ edit ]  As of 2012, Ditko continued to work in Manhattan\\'s Midtown West neighborhood. [90] [94] He mostly declined to give interviews or make public appearances, explaining in 1969 that, \"When I do a job, it\\'s not my personality that I\\'m offering the readers but my artwork. It\\'s not what I\\'m like that counts; it\\'s what I did and how well it was done. I produce a product, a comic art story. Steve Ditko is the brand name.\" [95] However, he did contribute numerous essays to Robin Snyder\\'s fanzine The Comics . [96] Ditko was an ardent supporter of Objectivism . [97] [98]  He had a nephew who became an artist, also named Steve Ditko. [54] As far as it is known, he never married and had no surviving children at the time of his death. [90] [99]  Will Eisner stated that Ditko had a son out of wedlock, [100] but this may have been a confused reference to the nephew. [90]  Ditko said in 2012 that he had made no income on the four Spider-Man films released to that time. [90] However, a neighbor of Ditko\\'s stated that he received royalty checks. [101] Those involved with creating the Doctor Strange film purposely declined to contact him during production, believing they would not be welcome. [99]  Ditko was found unresponsive in his apartment in New York City on June 29, 2018. Police said he had died within the previous two days. He was pronounced dead at age 90, with the cause of death initially deemed as a result of a myocardial infarction , brought on by arteriosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease . [99]  The final words of Ditko\\'s last essay, published posthumously in Down Memory Lane in February 2019, quoted an \"old toast\" and were appropriately cantankerous: \"Here\\'s to those who wish me well, and those that don\\'t can go to hell.\" [102]   Awards and honors [ edit ]  1962 Alley Award for Best Short Story: \"Origin of Spider-Man \" by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Amazing Fantasy #15 (Marvel Comics).  1963 Alley Award for Best Adventure Hero Comic Book: The Amazing Spider-Man  1963 Alley Award for Top Hero: Spider-Man  1964 Alley Award for Best Adventure Hero Comic Book: The Amazing Spider-Man  1964 Alley Award for Best Giant Comic: The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1  1964 Alley Award for Best Hero: Spider-Man  1965 Alley Award for Best Adventure Hero Comic Book: The Amazing Spider-Man  1965 Alley Award for Best Hero: Spider-Man  1985 Eagle Award : Roll of Honour [103]  In 1987, Ditko was presented a Comic-Con International  Inkpot Award in absentia, accepted on his behalf by Renegade Press publisher Deni Loubert , who had published Ditko\\'s World the previous year. Ditko refused the award, and returned it to Loubert after having phoned her to say, \"Awards bleed the artist and make us compete against each other. They are the most horrible things in the world. How dare you accept this on my behalf\". At his behest, Loubert returned the award to the convention organizers. [104]  1991 UK Comic Art Award Career Achievement Award [105]  Ditko was inducted into the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990 and into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994.  2015 Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame Award  BBC documentary [ edit ]  In September 2007, presenter Jonathan Ross hosted a one-hour documentary for BBC Four titled In Search of Steve Ditko . The program covers Ditko\\'s work at Marvel, DC, and Charlton Comics and at Wally Wood\\'s witzend , as well as his following of Objectivism. It includes testimonials by Alan Moore , Mark Millar , Jerry Robinson and Stan Lee, among others. Ross, accompanied by writer Neil Gaiman , met Ditko briefly at his New York office, but he declined to be filmed, interviewed or photographed. He did, however, give the two a selection of some comic books. At the end of the show, Ross said he had since spoken to Ditko on the telephone and, as a joke, that he was now on first name terms with him.

For the most well known iteration, see Norman Osborn . For a comprehensive list of the Goblin characters, see Goblin (Marvel Comics) .    Green Goblin Norman Osborn as Green Goblin. Artwork for the cover of Amazing Spider-Man #797 (March 2018 Marvel Comics). Art by Alex Ross . Publication information Publisher Marvel Comics First appearance The Amazing Spider-Man #14 (July 1964) Created by Stan Lee Steve Ditko In-story information Alter ego Norman Osborn Harry Osborn Bart Hamilton Phil Urich Species Human mutate Notable aliases Goblin King, Goblin Knight, Red Goblin Abilities  Superhuman strength, stamina, durability, agility and reflexes due to ingesting the Goblin Formula  Regeneration  Genius-level intellect  Master hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist  Using goblin-themed weapons and a Goblin Glider which has a variety of offensive weapons as paraphernalia   The Green Goblin is the alias of several fictional supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . The first and best known incarnation, Norman Osborn , created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko , is generally considered to be the archenemy of Spider-Man . [1] Originally a manifestation of chemically induced insanity, others such as Norman\\'s son Harry Osborn would take on the persona. The Green Goblin is a Halloween -themed supervillain whose weapons resemble bats, ghosts and jack-o\\'-lanterns and in most incarnations uses a hoverboard or glider to fly. Comics journalist and historian Mike Conroy writes of the character: \"Of all the costumed villains who\\'ve plagued Spider-Man over the years, the most flat-out unhinged and terrifying of them all is the Green Goblin.\" [2] The Green Goblin has appeared in several films including 2002\\'s Spider-Man , 2004\\'s Spider-Man 2 , and 2007\\'s Spider-Man 3 with Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, and 2014\\'s The Amazing Spider-Man 2 with Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn. The 2007 film also portrayed James Franco as a version of the Green Goblin character.

Cover art by Steve Ditko .  According to Steve Ditko:   Stan\\'s synopsis for the Green Goblin had a movie crew, on location, finding an Egyptian -like sarcophagus . Inside was an ancient, mythological  demon , the Green Goblin. He naturally came to life. On my own, I changed Stan\\'s mythological demon into a human villain. [3]    The Green Goblin debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #14. [4] At this time his identity was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which made a point of his secret identity . According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr. , who replaced Ditko as the title\\'s artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn\\'t yet been introduced. [5] [6] [7] Lee elaborated:   Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it\\'s somebody you didn\\'t know and had never seen, then what was the point of following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader. [7]    However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character. [a] [7] Moreover, in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko\\'s. [8] Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37). [3] [9]  Ditko left the series with issue #38, just one issue after Norman Osborn was introduced as the father of Harry Osborn . The first issue without Ditko saw the Green Goblin unmasked. John Romita, Sr. , who replaced Ditko as the title\\'s artist, recalled: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} Stan wouldn\\'t have been able to stand it if Ditko did the story and didn\\'t reveal that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn. I didn\\'t know there was any doubt about Osborn being the Goblin. I didn\\'t know that Ditko had just been setting Osborn up as a straw dog. I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it. I had been following the last couple of issues and didn\\'t think there was really much mystery about it. Looking back, I doubt the Goblin\\'s identity would have been revealed in Amazing #39 if Ditko had stayed on. [10]  In the landmark story, \" The Night Gwen Stacy Died \" ( The Amazing Spider-Man #121–122), the Green Goblin kills Gwen Stacy and later perishes in a fight against Spider-Man. However, the story\\'s writer, Gerry Conway , had Harry Osborn adopt the Green Goblin identity in that story\\'s aftermath, later remarking that \"I never had any intention of getting rid of the Green Goblin as a concept\". [11] Harry Osborn\\'s becoming the Green Goblin was mostly well-received, with fans remarking that Harry was more menacing than his father had ever been. [12]  Several other characters would take on the Green Goblin identity, and writer Roger Stern later introduced the Hobgoblin to replace the Green Goblin as Spider-Man\\'s archenemy. [13] In addition, a retcon during the \" Clone Saga \" determined that the original Green Goblin survived the events of The Amazing Spider-Man #122 and had been playing a behind-the-scenes role in Spider-Man\\'s adventures since then.  Fictional character biography [ edit ]  Norman Osborn [ edit ]  Main article: Norman Osborn  Norman Osborn is the first and most-known character connected with the Green Goblin alias who developed the equipment used by the others ever since he was exposed to the Goblin formula.  Harry Osborn [ edit ]  Main article: Harry Osborn  Harold \"Harry\" Osborn is Norman Osborn\\'s son and the second character who used the Green Goblin alias.  Bart Hamilton [ edit ]  Dr. Barton \"Bart\" Hamilton was a psychologist born in Scarsdale, New York and the third character to use the Green Goblin alias. When Harry was put under medical care, Dr. Hamilton managed to make Harry bury the vendetta as the Goblin identity from Harry\\'s subconscious via hypnosis . [14] Dr. Hamilton uses these secrets to be the third Goblin. [15] But since Harry has no knowledge of where Norman\\'s strength-enhancing Goblin formula is, Hamilton is unable to locate it. He hatches an elaborate plot to kill Silvermane but Harry resumes the Goblin identity to stop him. They battle and Hamilton is accidentally killed by a bomb with which he meant to kill Spider-Man . [16]  Years later, there was speculation that Hamilton was the Hobgoblin but this is disproved. [17]  A Goblin that was presumably Hamilton appears as a member of the second incarnation of the Legion of the Unliving created by the Grandmaster . After being pitted against the Avengers , the group and their master are vanquished by Death . [18]  During the Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy storyline, Bart\\'s Goblin form is cloned by the Jackal \\'s company New U Technologies. [19]   Phil Urich [ edit ]  Main article: Phil Urich  Philip Benjamin \"Phil\" Urich is nephew of Ben Urich and the fourth character to use the Green Goblin alias.  Nameless construct [ edit ]  Norman begins trying to convince the public after returning from the dead of never being the infamous supervillain, and conspired with associate Doctor Angst genetically engineer a new Green Goblin, one slavishly devoted to help his case. [20] Norman uses this Goblin as a bodyguard , [21] to torment Spider-Man, [22] and in ploys designed to draw public sympathy (such as kidnapping Normie Osborn for ransom). [23] After Norman is incapacitated by the Gathering of Five , the Goblin is left alone and begins to degenerate due to no longer having access to the Goblin Formula required to keep him stable. The Goblin goes after Liz Allan in a desperate bid to find a cure for his condition, but is driven off by Spider-Man. [24] During a second attempt to capture Liz, the Goblin unmasks himself in front of Spider-Man (shuffling through a variety of faces (with the most prominent being Harry Osborn) after doing so) and melts into a pile of protoplasm as he claims Norman would return. [20]   Powers and abilities [ edit ]  In his first appearances, the Green Goblin seems to be a normal man (albeit very nimble and athletic) who gets his powers from his many gadgets. In later appearances, it is established that due to the \"Goblin Formula\", Norman and most successors to the Green Goblin persona possesses superhuman strength (lifting nine tons under optimal conditions), increased speed, reflexes, endurance, intelligence and healing rate, while Norman started with a portion of the chemical\\'s power because of an accidental splash in the face during the time where one had to bathe in it long enough to get the full effect before the drinking version was created. Though much slower than the likes of Wolverine , he can regenerate damaged tissue and organs. However, if seriously wounded, it would leave scars on his body. His intelligence has been enhanced to gifted levels, though at the price of his sanity. His involvement with the Gathering of the Five loosened his grip on reality, though he is able to maintain some semblance of his sanity via chemically treated dermal patches. When not impaired by mental illness, Osborn is a cunning businessman, masterful strategist, and highly skilled in electronics, mechanics, engineering and chemistry. The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He travels on his bat -shaped \"Goblin Glider\", an incredibly fast and maneuverable rocket glider equipped with various armaments. Other weapons the Goblin uses include incendiary Pumpkin Bombs and Ghost Bombs, smoke- and gas-emitting grenades resembling jack-\\'o\\'-lanterns and ghosts, respectively, razor-edged boomerang -like throwing weapons called razor bats and gloves woven with micro-circuited filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity at nearly 10,000 volts . He wears a green costume underneath bulletproof chainmail with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses.  Goblin Glider [ edit ]  In the Green Goblin\\'s first appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man #14, he rides a steel rocket-powered wingless broomstick (not a glider). In his second appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man #17, he changes to the familiar bat-shaped glider. The Goblin Glider\\'s controls and microprocessor are located behind the head of the glider. The pilot is attached to the glider via electromagnetic clasps on the wings of the glider. It has great maneuverability and is steered mostly by leaning, but manual controls are available behind the head of the glider. The Goblin later added radio-linked voice controls to his mask. Its top speed is 90 miles per hour (140\\xa0km/h), and it can support about 400\\xa0lb (180\\xa0kg), though it could lift far more for brief periods. Flying at top speed with a full load and a full fuel tank would deplete its fuel supply in about an hour. In the Goblin\\'s later appearances, the glider possesses a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a Pumpkin Bomb dispenser/launcher.  Pumpkin Bombs, Ghost Bombs, and the \"Bag of Tricks\" [ edit ]  A grenade used by the Green Goblin, the Pumpkin Bomb resembles a miniature Jack-o\\'-lantern and, when thrown, ignites almost soundlessly and produces enough heat to melt through a 3-inch (76\\xa0mm) thick sheet of steel. The Goblin carries these and a variety of other weapons, such as razor bats (akin to bladed boomerangs) and miniature \"Ghost Bombs\", in an over-the-shoulder satchel he calls his \"Bag of Tricks\". The Green Goblin has a range of other \"Pumpkin Bombs\" and \"Ghost Bombs\" at his disposal, including smoke-and gas-emitting bombs. Some release hallucinogenic gases, while others emit a specially-created mixture that neutralizes Spider-Man \\'s spider-sense for a limited period of time. Still others emit a flame-retarding gas, which the Goblin once used against the Human Torch . [25] All of these are covered in a light plastic coating.  Groups [ edit ]  Goblinettes [ edit ]  Some time after Norman\\'s death, Harry is abducted by a trio of mysterious female Goblins. With the aid of Ben Urich and Molten Man , Spider-Man discovers that these \"Goblinettes\" are robots created by Harry, and controlled by a supercomputer containing copies of Harry and Norman\\'s minds. The Goblinettes are destroyed along with the computer, which had been programmed to expose Normie Osborn to the same version of Goblin serum that killed Harry, in attempt to create a new Green Goblin. [26]   Order of the Goblin [ edit ]  An offshoot of the Scriers cult founded by Norman, consisting of only his most loyal followers.  Goblin Gangs [ edit ]  Following Norman\\'s rise and fall from power, a number of Goblin Gangs sprang up across America. Composed mostly of white supremacists who agreed with his plans to remove the Asgardians from the country, they wear purple clothes, green face makeup and have goblin-based tattoos. [27]  Vin Gonzales was revealed to have received one of these tattoos while in prison passing a message from Norman to Harry about Stanley Osborn. [28]   Goblin Nation [ edit ]  The Goblin Nation, also known as the Goblin Underground, is a group of organized crime composed of Goblin-themed villains led by the Goblin King against the Superior Spider-Man . [29]   War Goblins [ edit ]  In the eight-month ellipsis that occurred subsequent to the events of Secret Wars , a heavily bandaged arms dealer claiming to be Norman Osborn began selling Goblin-based costumes and equipment on the black market, establishing private armies of \"War Goblins\". [30]   Other versions [ edit ]  As a fictional character, the Green Goblin has appeared in a number of media, from comic books to films and television series . Each version of the character is typically established within its own continuity within parallel universes , to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified. Various versions of the Goblin are depicted in works such as Marvel\\'s Ultimate line and Earth X .  2099 [ edit ]  In the Marvel 2099 setting, the Goblin is a radical trickster who wants to prove that Spider-Man (Miguel O\\'Hara) is in the pay of a megacorp like Alchemax . He has bat-like glider-wings and a bag of \"tricks\", similar to the 20th century version. He also has the ability to project illusions. [31]  He is eventually unmasked, and appears to be Spider-Man\\'s brother Gabriel O\\'Hara , although it is later revealed, in a retcon , that he is a shapeshifter who took Gabriel\\'s identity. Writer Peter David , who quit the book between creating the character and the unmasking, has said that it was his intent for the Goblin to be female Catholic  priest named Father Jennifer, and for Gabriel to be a red herring . [32] [33] This Goblin was never called the Green Goblin, but instead simply Goblin 2099 . [31]  In All-New, All-Different Marvel , during a travel to 2099, Spider-Man (O\\'Hara) is captured by that era\\'s Venom and Doctor Octopus. Miguel later wakes up in Alchemax, which is run by that era\\'s Sinister Six. The Sinister Six discover that the Goblin is actually Father Jennifer D\\'Angelo, an undercover ally of Kasey. After receiving a message from the Sinister Six, Miguel and Kasey go to Alchemax to rescue Father Jennifer. Upon escaping, Spider-Man and Father Jennifer arrive at an area where the time door appears, but Jennifer is killed by Doctor Octopus.  In other media [ edit ]  The Green Goblin 2099 is a playable character and a boss in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 . [34] He first appears in Manhattan, after it has been made part of Chronopolis , and fights Spider-Man and Spider-Gwen alongside the Vulture , but both villains are swiftly defeated. Later, the Goblin 2099 obtains a shard of the Nexus of All Realities, which he uses to fuse Venom and Carnage into a new creature, dubbed \" Carnom ,\" whom he controls. When Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel , She-Hulk , Spider-Gwen, and Spider-Man 2099 arrive in Nueva York (also part of Chronopolis) and break into Alchemax to retrieve the shard, the Goblin 2099 unleashes Carnom upon them, but they defeat him and free him from the Goblin\\'s control. The Goblin 2099 is last seen being pursued by Carnom in retaliaton for his abuse.  Avataars: Covenant of the Shield [ edit ]  In the miniseries Avataars: Covenant of the Shield , which takes place in an alternative universe referred to as Eurth created by the Shaper of Worlds , the Green Goblin appears as the Goblin King . A small, nimble creature green in color and adorned in purple rags, the Goblin King is shown to speak solely in rhyme and runs a toll booth in the Webwood, extorting goods from travelers along with his henchmen the Six Most Sinister . [35]   House of M [ edit ]  In the Spider-Man: House of M from the 2005 Marvel comics series House of M , there are two versions of the Green Goblin.  The first is Peter\\'s wrestling friend and rival Crusher Hogan , who uses the identity as his wrestling franchise.  The second is Peter Parker himself, who, feeling guilty posing as a mutant when really he was a human given powers in the usual Spider-Man fashion (radioactive spider bite), poses as the Green Goblin to reveal the information about him being a human to J. Jonah Jameson , his then publicist, and eventually the entire world. Norman Osborn is also present in this continuity, as an industrialist whose company is bought out by Peter. [36]  MC2 [ edit ]  Fury the Goblin Queen [ edit ]  Élan DeJunae, daughter of the San Mardeo DeJunae crime family in South America, is betrothed to Normie Osborn when she is just a baby because of her father\\'s involvement with the Order of the Goblin. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  From then on, Élan learns the family business and eventually makes connections with the Black Tarantula . She grows up training to follow Norman Osborn\\'s footsteps, and eventually becomes the leader of the Order of the Goblin. Following a near fatal attack on Normie, Élan returns to New York to follow through with their arranged marriage, but Normie was not aware of the betrothal. Meanwhile, Élan and the Black Tarantula plot to use Spider-Girl to destroy Lady Octopus and Canis so they can take control of the New York underworld. Following plans made by Norman Osborn before his death, the Queen of the Goblins tries to dose Normie Osborn with a new version of the Goblin Formula. Spider-Girl manages to defeat Élan, but in the battle, the formula explodes and the Queen escapes. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Because Normie spurned her and denied his place in the Goblin legacy, Fury crashes his wedding to Brenda Drago and forcibly bonds the Venom - symbiote to him in an attempt to corrupt him. This backfires, as Normie gained control of the symbiote and went on to become a hero. After Fury crashed Normie\\'s wedding, Phil Urich (the good Green Goblin) defeats her and sends her to prison. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Normie Osborn [ edit ]  Main article: Normie Osborn  Normie Osborn is the son of Harry Osborn and Liz Allan, and the grandson of Norman Osborn. In the alternative timeline of the MC2 universe he becomes the Green Goblin and battles Spider-Man\\'s daughter, May \"Mayday\" Parker , before reforming and becoming her ally. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Phil Urich [ edit ]  In the MC2 timeline, Phil Urich marries his girlfriend Meredith and is a forensic scientist and friends with Peter Parker. He is aware of both Peter and Spider-Girl \\'s identities. Phil Urich resumes the Goblin identity, first under the name of the Golden Goblin , then as the Green Goblin with the assistance of Normie Osborn (III). After Phil lost a long series of battles, Normie recreates Phil\\'s original mask, which grants him superhuman strength and other abilities, greatly enhancing his effectiveness. He is also a founding member of the New New Warriors . [37]   Spider-Man: India [ edit ]  Spider-Man: India features Nalin Oberoi , a ruthless businessman in Mumbai , who is ravaging villages for a mystical amulet to connect with evil, supernatural demons who once ruled the world. [38] The process works and transforms Oberoi into \"Green Goblin\". He also transforms a meek doctor into \"Doctor Octopus\" and sends him to find Pavitar Prabhakar (Spider-Man). Oberoi later burns down Pavitar\\'s village (branding it with his initials NO), and kidnaps MJ, and Aunt Maya ( Aunt May ). [39] At Oberoi HQ, he tries to bring down the demons, until a reformed Octopus and Pavitar attack and rescue the ladies. After killing the doctor, Oberoi is later defeated by Pavitar. [40] Oberoi also has a son mentioned by Pavitar, Hari.

The Big Man was a mob villain who, like the Green Goblin, was created by Lee/Ditko and had the mystery of his identity played up before being unmasked as someone Spider-Man knew from his civilian life. Moreover, later in the interview Lee suggests that he had the Green Goblin confused with \"a gangster\".

       " 'X Men': 'Comic book superhero team  This article is about the superhero team. For other uses, see X-Men (disambiguation) .    X-Men Variant cover of X-Men Legacy #275 (December 2012) by Mark Brooks depicting Rogue , Wolverine , Cyclops , Namor the Sub-Mariner , Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat (with her dragon Lockheed ), Pixie , Storm , Angel , Cannonball , Emma Frost , Rachel Summers , Hope Summers , Magneto , Psylocke , Beast , Colossus , Magik , Gambit and Iceman . Publication information Publisher Marvel Comics First appearance The X-Men #1 (September 1963) Created by Stan Lee Jack Kirby In-story information Base(s) Xavier\\'s School for Gifted Youngsters , Westchester County, New York (historically) Krakoa (currently) Leader(s) Professor X Member(s) List  The X-Men are a team of fictional mutant superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . Created by artist/co-writer Jack Kirby and writer Stan Lee , the characters first appeared in The X-Men #1 (September 1963) and formed one of the most recognizable and successful franchises of Marvel Comics, appearing in numerous books, television shows , films , and video games . Most of the X-Men are mutants , a subspecies of humans who are born with superhuman abilities activated by the \"X-Gene\". The X-Men fight for peace and equality between normal humans and mutants in a world where anti-mutant bigotry is fierce and widespread. They are led by Charles Xavier, also known as Professor X , a powerful mutant telepath who can control and read minds. Their archenemy is Magneto , a powerful mutant with the ability to manipulate and control magnetic fields who leads the Brotherhood of Mutants . Both have opposing views and philosophies regarding the relationship between mutants and humans. While the former works towards peace and understanding between mutants and humans, the latter views humans as a threat and believes in taking an aggressive approach against them, though he has found himself working alongside the X-Men from time to time. Professor X is the founder of Xavier\\'s School for Gifted Youngsters at a location commonly called the X-Mansion , which recruits mutants from around the world to teach them how to use their powers and coexist with humanity. Located in Salem Center in Westchester County, New York , the X-Mansion is the home and training site of the X-Men. The founding five members of the X-Men who appear in The X-Men #1 (September 1963) are Angel-Archangel , Beast , Cyclops , Iceman and Jean Grey (as Marvel Girl); Professor X and Magneto also made their first appearances in The X-Men #1. Eventually, the X-Men roster expanded to include a wide variety of members from numerous origins, including Wolverine , Storm , Nightcrawler , Colossus , Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat , Rogue , Gambit and Psylocke . Since then, dozens of mutants from various countries and diverse backgrounds, and even a number of non-mutants, have held membership as X-Men.

In 2004, Lee recalled, \"I couldn\\'t have everybody bitten by a radioactive spider or exposed to a gamma ray explosion. And I took the cowardly way out. I said to myself, \\'Why don\\'t I just say they\\'re mutants ? They were born that way. \\' \" [1]  In a 1987 interview, Kirby said:  The X-Men, I did the natural thing there. What would you do with mutants who were just plain boys and girls and certainly not dangerous? You school them. You develop their skills. So I gave them a teacher, Professor X. Of course, it was the natural thing to do, instead of disorienting or alienating people who were different from us, I made the X-Men part of the human race, which they were. Possibly, radiation, if it is beneficial, may create mutants that\\'ll save us instead of doing us harm. I felt that if we train the mutants our way, they\\'ll help us – and not only help us, but achieve a measure of growth in their own sense. And so, we could all live together. [2]  Lee devised the series title after Marvel publisher Martin Goodman turned down the initial name, \"The Mutants,\" stating that readers would not know what a \"mutant\" was. [3]  Within the Marvel Universe , the X-Men are widely regarded to have been named after Professor Xavier himself. The original explanation for the name, as provided by Xavier in The X-Men #1 (1963), is that mutants \"possess an extra power ... one which ordinary humans do not!! That is why I call my students ... X-Men, for EX-tra power!\" [4]   Publication history [ edit ]  Original roster [ edit ] The creators of the series were inspired by the Doom Patrol , a group of young superheroes published by the competitor DC Comics who because of their superpowers were marginalized just like the young mutants of Marvel.  The original X-Men members that were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby , showing their original design  Early X-Men issues introduced the original team composed of Cyclops , Marvel Girl , Beast , Angel , and Iceman , along with their archenemy Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants featuring Mastermind , Quicksilver , Scarlet Witch , and Toad . The comic focused on a common human theme of good versus evil and later included storylines and themes about prejudice and racism , all of which have persisted throughout the series in one form or another. The evil side in the fight was shown in human form and under some sympathetic beginnings via Magneto, a character who was later revealed to have survived Nazi concentration camps only to pursue a hatred for normal humanity. His key followers, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, were Romani . Only one new member of the X-Men was added, Mimic /Calvin Rankin, [5] but soon left due to his temporary loss of power. [6]  The title lagged in sales behind Marvel\\'s other comic franchises. In 1969, writer Roy Thomas and illustrator Neal Adams rejuvenated the comic book and gave regular roles to two recently introduced characters: Havok /Alex Summers (who had been introduced by Roy Thomas before Adams began work on the comic) and Lorna Dane, later called Polaris (created by Arnold Drake and Jim Steranko ). However, these later X-Men issues failed to attract sales and Marvel stopped producing new stories with issue #66, later reprinting a number of the older comics as issues #67–93.

Cover art by Gil Kane and Dave Cockrum.  In Giant-Size X-Men #1 (1975), writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum introduced a new team that starred in a revival of The X-Men , beginning with issue #94 . This new team replaced the previous members with the exception of Cyclops, who remained. This team differed greatly from the original. Unlike in the early issues of the original series, the new team was not made up of teenagers and they also had a more diverse background. Marvel\\'s corporate owners, Cadence Industries , had suggested the new team should be international, feeling it needed characters with \"foreign appeal\". [8] So each character was from a different country with varying cultural and philosophical beliefs, and all were already well-versed in using their mutant powers, several being experienced in combat. The \"all-new, all-different X-Men\" [9] were led by Cyclops, from the original team, and consisted of the newly created Colossus (from the Soviet Union/Russia), Nightcrawler (from West Germany/Germany), Storm (from Kenya), and Thunderbird (a Native American of Apache descent), and three previously introduced characters: Banshee (from Ireland), Sunfire (from Japan), and Wolverine (from Canada). Wolverine eventually became the breakout character on the team and, in terms of comic sales and appearances, the most popular X-Men character even getting his own solo title . Sunfire would reject membership of the X-Men shortly after their first mission. However, this team would not remain whole for long as Sunfire quit immediately and never really accepted the other members, and Thunderbird would die in the very next mission. Filling in the vacancy, a revamped Jean Grey soon rejoined the X-Men under her new persona of \"Phoenix\". Angel, Beast, Iceman, Havok , and Polaris also made significant guest appearances. The revived series was illustrated by Cockrum, and later by John Byrne , and written by Chris Claremont . Claremont became the series\\' longest-running contributor. [10] The run met with critical acclaim and produced such landmark storylines as the death of Thunderbird, the emergence of Phoenix, the saga of the Starjammers and the M\\'Kraan Crystal, the introduction of Alpha Flight and the Proteus saga. [11] Other characters introduced during this time include Amanda Sefton , Mystique , and Moira MacTaggert , with her genetic research facility on Muir Island . The 1980s began with the comic\\'s best-known story arc, the Dark Phoenix Saga , which saw Phoenix manipulated by the illusionist Mastermind and becoming corrupted with an overwhelming lust for power and destruction as the evil Dark Phoenix. Other important storylines included Days of Future Past , the saga of Deathbird and the Brood , the discovery of the Morlocks, the invasion of the Dire Wraiths and The Trial of Magneto, as well as X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills , the partial inspiration for the 2003 movie X2: X-Men United . [12]    Uncanny X-Men #227 (March 1988) by Chris Claremont and Marc Silvestri  By the early 1980s, X-Men was Marvel\\'s top-selling comic title. Its sales were such that distributors and retailers began using an \"X-Men index\", rating each comic book publication by how many orders it garnered compared to that month\\'s issue of X-Men . [13] The growing popularity of Uncanny X-Men and the rise of comic book specialty stores led to the introduction of a number of ongoing spin-off series nicknamed \"X-Books.\" The first of these was The New Mutants , soon followed by Alpha Flight , X-Factor , Excalibur , and a solo Wolverine title. When Claremont conceived a story arc, the Mutant Massacre , which was too long to run in the monthly X-Men , editor Louise Simonson decided to have it overlap into several X-Books. The story was a major financial success, [14] and when the later Fall of the Mutants was similarly successful, the marketing department declared that the X-Men lineup would hold such crossovers annually. [15]  Throughout the decade, Uncanny X-Men was written solely by Chris Claremont, and illustrated for long runs by John Byrne, Dave Cockrum, Paul Smith , John Romita Jr. , and Marc Silvestri . Additions to the X-Men during this time were Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat , Rogue , Jean Grey /Phoenix, Psylocke , Dazzler , Longshot , Jubilee , Forge and Gambit . In a controversial move, Professor X relocated to outer space to be with Lilandra Neramani , Majestrix of the Shi\\'ar Empire, in 1986. Magneto then joined the X-Men in Xavier\\'s place and became the director of the New Mutants. This period also included the emergence of the Hellfire Club , the arrival of the mysterious Madelyne Pryor , and the villains Apocalypse , Mister Sinister , Mojo , and Sabretooth .  Blue and Gold (1991–2001) [ edit ]   The tetraptych cover of X-Men , vol. 2, #1 (October 1991). Art by Jim Lee and Scott Williams.  In 1991, Marvel revised the entire lineup of X-Men comic book titles, centered on the launch of a second X-Men series, simply titled X-Men . With the return of Xavier and the original X-Men to the team, the roster was split into two strike forces: Cyclops\\'s \"Blue Team\" (chronicled in X-Men ) and Storm\\'s \"Gold Team\" (in The Uncanny X-Men ). The first issues of the second X-Men series were written by Claremont and drawn and co-plotted by Jim Lee . Retailers pre-ordered over 8.1 million copies of issue #1, generating and selling nearly $7 million (though retailers probably sold closer to 3 million copies), [16] making it, according to Guinness Book of World Records , the best-selling comic book of all-time. Guinness presented honors to Claremont at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con . [17] [18] [19]  Another new X-book released at the time was X-Force , featuring the characters from The New Mutants , led by Cable ; it was written by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza . Internal friction soon split the X-books\\' creative teams. In a controversial move, X-Men editor Bob Harras sided with Lee (and Uncanny X-Men artist Whilce Portacio ) over Claremont in a dispute over plotting. Claremont left after only three issues of X-Men , ending his 16-year run as X-Men writer. [20] Marvel replaced Claremont briefly with John Byrne , who scripted both books for a few issues. Byrne was then replaced by Nicieza and Scott Lobdell , who would take over the majority of writing duties for the X-Men until Lee\\'s own departure months later when he and several other popular artists (including former X-title artists Liefeld, Portacio, and Marc Silvestri ) would leave Marvel to form Image Comics . Jim Lee\\'s X-Men designs would be the basis for much of the X-Men animated series and action figure line as well as several Capcom video games. The 1990s saw an even greater number of X-books with numerous ongoing series and miniseries running concurrently. X-book crossovers continued to run annually, with \" The X-Tinction Agenda \" in 1990, \" The Muir Island Saga \" in 1991, \" X-Cutioner\\'s Song \" in 1992, \" Fatal Attractions \" in 1993, \" Phalanx Covenant \" in 1994, \" Legion Quest \"/\" Age of Apocalypse \" in 1995, \" Onslaught \" in 1996, and \" Operation: Zero Tolerance \" in 1997. Though the frequent crossovers were criticized by fans as well as editorial and creative staff for being artificially regular, disruptive to the direction of the individual series, and having far less lasting impact than promised, they continued to be financially successful. [15]  There were many new popular additions to the X-Men in the 1990s, including Gambit , Cable , and Bishop . Gambit became one of the most popular X-Men, rivaling even Wolverine in size of fanbase after his debut in Uncanny X-Men #266 (Aug. 1990). Many of the later additions to the team came and went, such as Joseph , Maggott , Marrow , Cecilia Reyes , and a new Thunderbird . Xavier\\'s New Mutants grew up and became X-Force , and the next generation of students began with Generation X , featuring Jubilee and other teenage mutants led and schooled by Banshee and ex-villainess Emma Frost at her Massachusetts Academy. In 1998, Excalibur and X-Factor ended and the latter was replaced with Mutant X , starring Havok stranded in a parallel universe . Marvel launched a number of solo series, including Deadpool , Cable , Bishop , X-Man , and Gambit , but few of the series would survive the decade.  Morrison Era (2001–2004) [ edit ]   The cover to New X-Men #114. Art by Frank Quitely .  In 2000, Claremont returned to Marvel and was put back on the primary X-Men titles during the Revolution revamp. He was later removed from the titles in 2001 and created his spin-off series, X-Treme X-Men . X-Men had its title changed to New X-Men and writer Grant Morrison took over. The book is often referred to as the Morrison-era, due to the drastic changes they made, beginning with \" E Is For Extinction \", where a new villain, Cassandra Nova , destroys Genosha , killing sixteen million mutants. Morrison also brought reformed ex-villain Emma Frost into the primary X-Men team, and opened the doors of the school by having Xavier \"out\" himself to the public about being a mutant. The bright spandex costumes that had become iconic over the previous decades were replaced by black leather street clothes reminiscent of the uniforms of the X-Men films. Morrison also introduced Xorn , who would figure prominently in the climax of his run. Ultimate X-Men set in Marvel\\'s revised imprint was also launched, while Chuck Austen began his controversial run on Uncanny X-Men . Several short-lived spin-offs and miniseries started featuring several X-Men in solo series, such as Emma Frost, Mystique and Nightcrawler. Another series, Exiles , started at the same time and concluded in December 2007 which led to New Exiles in January 2008 written by Claremont. Notable additions to the X-Men have been Emma Frost, Danielle Moonstar , Husk and Northstar while former villain Juggernaut became member of the X-Men. Notable story arcs of this era are \" E Is For Extinction \" (2001), \" Planet X \" and \" Here Comes Tomorrow \".

X-Men ReLoad was the name given by Marvel Comics to their May 2004 revamp of the X-Men titles with new looks for the characters and fresh plot points. The revamp was prompted by Grant Morrison\\'s departure from New X-Men. As a result of the revamp, Chris Claremont moved from writing X-Treme X-Men to writing Uncanny X-Men, with Alan Davis doing the art. Chuck Austen moved from writing Uncanny X-Men to New X-Men, which returned to its old name of simply X-Men, with Salvador Larroca, who had been working with him on Uncanny X-Men doing the art. Finally, Joss Whedon entered as the writer of the new title Astonishing X-Men , with John Cassaday as artist. X-Treme X-Men was cancelled. Also, the X-Men returned to more traditional (if not slightly revised) costumes, as opposed to the black leather uniforms from the movies. New X-Men: Academy X was also launched focusing on the lives of the new young mutants at the institute. This period included the resurrections of Colossus and Psylocke, a new death for Jean Grey, who later returned temporarily in the X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong , as well as Emma Frost becoming the new headmistress of the institute. The institute, formerly run as a school (until the depowering of 98% of the mutant population), served as a safe haven to mutants who are still powered. Several short-lived spin-offs and miniseries started featuring several X-Men in solo series, such as Gambit and Rogue. Cable and Deadpool\\'s books were merged into one book, Cable & Deadpool . Notable additions to the X-Men have been Armor , Pixie and Warpath , while former villains such as Lady Mastermind , Mystique , and Sabretooth became members of the X-Men. Notable story arcs of this decade are \" Gifted \" (2004), \" House of M \" (2005), \" Deadly Genesis \" (2005–2006) and \" Endangered Species \" (2007).

In 2007, the \" Messiah Complex \" storyline saw the destruction of the Xavier Institute and the disbanding of the X-Men. It spun the new volumes of X-Force , following the team led by Wolverine, and Cable , following Cable\\'s attempts at protecting Hope Summers . X-Men was renamed into X-Men: Legacy which focused on Professor X, Rogue and Gambit. Under Cyclops\\'s leadership, the X-Men later reformed in Uncanny X-Men #500, with their new base located in San Francisco. [21]  In 2009, Messiah War \\',\" written by Craig Kyle and Chris Yost to serve as the second part in the trilogy that began with Messiah Complex,\" was released. Utopia written by Matt Fraction, was a crossover of Dark Avengers and Uncanny X-Men that served as a part of the \" Dark Reign \" storyline. A new New Mutants volume written by Zeb Wells, which featured the more prominent members of the original team reunited, was launched. Magneto joined the X-Men during the Nation X storyline to the dismay of other members of the X-Men, such as Beast, who left the team. [22] Magneto began to work with Namor to transform Utopia into a homeland for both mutants and Atlanteans. [23] After the conclusion of Utopia , Rogue became the main character of X-Men: Legacy .\\nIn 2010, \" Second Coming \" concluded the plot threads on Messiah Complex and Messiah War . Notable additions to the X-Men have been Pixie , Karma , Sunspot , Magma , Magik , Namor , Domino , Boom Boom , Fantomex and X-23 .

Meanwhile, Uncanny X-Men relaunched for the first time ever and served as the flagship title for Cyclops\\' Team. In 2012 \" Avengers vs. X-Men \" served as a closure to House of M and Decimation story lines. It featured the death of Professor X and the reappearance of new mutants after the return of the Phoenix Force. [24] [25]  Notable additions to the X-Men have been Warbird and Blink .

In 2012, as part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch, all X-Men titles (except Astonishing X-Men & Wolverine and the X-Men ) were canceled, including Uncanny X-Men , X-Men: Legacy , X-Men and New Mutants . New flagship title All-New X-Men was launched which featured the original five X-Men members who were brought to the present day by Beast and were made a separate team lead eventually by Kitty. The relaunched Uncanny X-Men featured Cyclops, his team and the new mutants, taking up residency in the Weapon X facility, which they have rebuilt into a school — the New Charles Xavier School for Mutants. An all female book titled simply X-Men was also launched. During All-New Marvel Now! , Astonishing X-Men was cancelled and in its place another flagship title Amazing X-Men was launched which featured the return of Nightcrawler and became the flagship title of Wolverine\\'s team. Also, Wolverine and the X-Men was relaunched and turned into mutants-in-training book. In 2013, for the 50th anniversary of the X-Men, \" Battle of the Atom \" was published which involved members of both X-Men schools trying to decide what to do about the time-displaced original X-Men, culminating in a confrontation with a version of the Brotherhood and the X-Men from an unspecified future date. In 2014, Wolverine was killed off in the \" Death of Wolverine \" story arc, as the conclusion of a storyline that saw him lose his healing factor after he was infected by an intelligent virus.

In 2015, as part of \" All-New, All-Different Marvel \", three team books were launched: the second volume of All-New X-Men , the fourth volume of Uncanny X-Men and Extraordinary X-Men . [26] X-23 took on the mantle of Wolverine and got a new solo series and Old Man Logan also received a new ongoing series when the character found himself in (from his perspective) an alternate past. During this period, the mutants dealt with the threat of the Terrigen cloud that circulated the world and appeared to be toxic to them, placing the X-Men at odds with the Inhumans . The X-Men also dealt with Apocalypse resurfacing, and the truth of what happened between Cyclops and the Inhumans that led to his death. Storm\\'s team resided in Limbo and worked to bring mutants to safety away from the Terrigen. Magneto\\'s team took on a more militant approach. Beast worked alongside the Inhumans to attempt to find a way to alter the state of the Terrigen, but later discovered that it couldn\\'t be altered and would have rendered Earth toxic for mutants. This revelation caused the X-Men to declare war against the Inhumans, but this conflict ended when the Inhumans learned what was happening, with Medusa sacrificing the Terrigen cloud to save the mutants. Notable story arcs of this era are \"Apocalypse Wars\" (2016), \" Death of X \" (2016) and \" Inhumans vs. X-Men \" (2016-2017).

It introduced new titles; X-Men Blue , X-Men Gold , Weapon X , new volumes of Astonishing X-Men and Generation X and new solo series for Cable, Jean Grey, and Iceman. With the Terrigen gone, the X-Men vacated Limbo and moved to Central Park where they returned to their heroic roots instead of constantly living in fear for their survival. Other notable changes include Kitty Pryde as the new leader of the X-Men, the time-displaced X-Men working with Magneto, Old Man Logan turning Weapon X into a black ops team, and mutant characters crossing over from Earth-1610 to the Earth-616 universe. Early 2018 saw the Phoenix Force returning to earth and mysteriously resurrecting the original Jean Grey. A new series featuring the original Jean leading a team of X-Men called X-Men Red was released later that same month. Rogue and Gambit\\'s relationship became a focal point during the Rogue & Gambit miniseries and again in the Till Death Do Us Part story arc in X-Men Gold , which saw the two finally tie the knot, and once more during the Mr. & Mrs. X miniseries, which saw the new couple attempt to take their honeymoon but end up involved in an intergalactic conspiracy. Other noteworthy plot points included Wolverine\\'s return coinciding with the arrival of a mysterious new villain named Persephone, Psylocke\\'s return to her original body, Magneto\\'s steady return to villainy, and the time-displaced X-Men facing the consequences of their presence in the 616 timeline, and the return of Cyclops. 2019 saw a new volume of Uncanny X-Men released beginning with a 10-part weekly story arc. Mainly Charles Xavier, Cyclops, Wolverine and Jean were resurrected and time displaced X-Men returned to their original timeline during the Extermination event.

Storytelling elements [ edit ]  The X-Men use many recurring plot-devices and motifs for their various story arcs over the years that have become commonplace within the X-Men canon.  Time travel [ edit ]  Many of the X-Men\\'s stories delve into time travel either in the sense of the team traveling through time on a mission, villains traveling through time to alter history, or certain characters traveling from the past or future in order to join the present team. Story arcs and spin-offs that are notable for using this plot device include Days of Future Past , Messiah Complex , All-New X-Men , Messiah War , and Battle of the Atom . Characters who are related to time travel include: Apocalypse, Bishop, Cable, Old Man Logan , Prestige, Hope Summers, Tempus , and Stryfe . [30] A major notable period in the X-Men\\'s history began in 2012s All-New X-Men when Beast used time-travel to bring the original five 1960s X-Men into the present. These time-displaced characters subsequently starred in their own title X-Men Blue before returning to their original timeline in 2018s Extermination event.  Death and resurrection [ edit ]  One of the most recurring plot devices used in the X-Men franchise is death and resurrection, mostly in the sense of Jean Grey and her bond with the Phoenix. Though not as iconic as Jean and the Phoenix, many other X-Men characters have died and come back to life on occasion. Death and resurrection has become such a common occurrence in the X-books that the characters have mentioned on numerous occasions that they\\'re not strangers to death or have made comments that death doesn\\'t always have a lasting effect on them (for example, \"In mutant heaven, there are no pearly gates, only revolving doors\"). X-Necrosha is a particular story arc that sees Selene temporarily reanimate many of the X-Men\\'s dead allies and enemies in order for her to achieve godhood. [31] [ non-tertiary source needed ]   Fate [ edit ]  Many of the characters deal with the topic of fate. In particular, Destiny \\'s abilities of precognition have affected certain plot points in the X-Men\\'s history long after she was killed off due to both the X-Men and their enemies constantly searching for her missing diaries that foretell certain futures. The topic of fate takes center stage yet again in a story arc called \"The Extremists\" involving attacks against the Morlocks due to one of them seeing a dark future for their people. [32] Some characters believe they already know their own fates, such as Apocalypse believing he is fated to rule the mutants or Magneto believing he is fated to lead the mutants to rise up against humans. Other characters such as Jean, Prestige, Evan Sabanur , Hope Summers, and Warren Worthington III have all been wary of their fates and have all taken measures to alter their futures.  Space travel [ edit ]  Space travel has been a common staple in the X-Men books beginning with the Phoenix and Dark Phoenix sagas. Since then space has been involved in many stories involving the X-Men\\'s allies and occasional rivals the Shi\\'ar along with stories involving the Phoenix Force. Space has been the setting for many stories involving the likes of The Brood , such as the story arc where the villainous species was first introduced. [33] Through space noteworthy characters like The Starjammers and Vulcan (lost brother of Cyclops and Havok) were introduced. Space Travel played a major role in Joss Whedon\\'s run on Astonishing X-Men via the introduction of S.W.O.R.D. and especially in one of the final story arcs under his authorship called \"Unstoppable\". [34] [35] Other notable story arcs involving space included \" X-Men: The End \", \"Rise and Fall of the Shi\\'ar Empire\", \" X-Men: Kingbreaker \", \" War of Kings \", and \" The Black Vortex \".  Sanity [ edit ]  The topic of sanity has been addressed in many of the major heroes and villains of X-Men. Most famously this is addressed in Jean Grey when she gains near omnipotence through the Phoenix and Professor Xavier after he violently uses his powers against Magneto, unintentionally creating Onslaught. Mystique\\'s sanity wavers throughout the franchise as her constant transformations causes more and more of her mind to fracture. [36] [37] Ever since swapping bodies with Revanche , Psylocke has occasionally struggled to maintain her sanity due to her more aggressive nature and new powers. The character Deadpool is famous for his blatant lack of sanity. After Magneto stripped Wolverine of his metal bones, Wolverine began to become increasingly feral throughout most of the mid to late 1990s X-Men comics. The nature of Rogue\\'s powers affecting her sanity due to her retaining the memories of others has been a central plot device on many occasions, most famously retaining Ms. Marvel\\'s psyche throughout most of the 1980s. Most recently Emma Frost\\'s sanity has become fractured ever since Cyclops died in her arms, causing her to declare war against Inhumans. [38] Other characters who have had issues with sanity include Cyclops, Sabretooth, Magik , Quentin Quire , X-23, and Prestige.  Political warfare [ edit ]  In the Marvel Universe, mutant rights is one of the hot controversial political topics and is something that is addressed numerous times in the X-books as a plot device. While some politicians like Valerie Cooper have legitimately tried to help the X-Men, most have made it their mission to discredit the X-Men in order to eliminate mutants once and for all. Senator Robert Kelly began his platform on a strong outspoken anti-mutant sentiment until he changed his mind after being rescued by mutants later on in his career. When Sabretooth\\'s human son Graydon Creed ran for office, the X-Men sent in Cannonball and Iceman to discreetly join his campaign team and find anything on his anti-mutant agenda. This continued until it boiled to a head when his assassination led to \" Operation: Zero Tolerance .\" Some of the issues presented in the comics serve as allegory to modern issues in the real world, such as Lydia Nance suggesting mass mutant deportation. [39] [40]   World of the X-Men [ edit ]  See also: Mutant (Marvel Comics)  The X-Men exist in the Marvel Universe along with other characters featured in Marvel Comics series and often interact with them. The X-Men/mutant corner of the Marvel Universe has been informally called \"X-Universe\". For instance, Wolverine was originally an antagonist to the Hulk before joining the X-Men and has ties to other heroes such as Captain America , Black Widow , the Thing , Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers) , Elektra and Spider-Man . Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are former Brotherhood of Mutants members who joined the Avengers , as have other X-Men characters such as Beast . Rogue got her powers via absorbing Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers) and the latter has also interacted with the X-Men. Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat has been part of the Guardians of the Galaxy and dated Star-Lord , she also served as a mentor to Franklin Richards the mutant son of Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman of the Fantastic Four . Storm was once the Queen of Wakanda and the wife of Black Panther , as well as a temporary member of the Fantastic Four. Rachel Summers was the girlfriend of Franklin Richards. Iceman and Angel have also joined the original Champions alongside Black Widow, Ghost Rider and Hercules as well as having frequent partnerships with Firestar and Spider-Man as \"The Amazing Friends\". Sabretooth was originally a villain of Iron Fist before becoming Wolverine\\'s archenemesis. And both the X-Men and the Avengers formed a team called Uncanny Avengers (aka Avengers Unity Division) after a conflict over the Phoenix Force . The global nature of the mutant concept means the scale of stories can be highly varied. The X-Men\\'s enemies range from mutant thieves to galactic threats. Historically, the X-Men have been based in the Xavier Institute of Gifted Youngsters/X-Mansion located in Salem Center , Westchester County, New York , and are often portrayed as a family. The Xavier\\'s School for Gifted Youngsters/X-Mansion is often depicted with three floors and two underground levels. To the outside world, it acted as a higher learning institute until the 2000s, when Xavier was publicly exposed as a mutant at which point it became a known mutant boarding school . Xavier funds a corporation aimed at reaching mutants worldwide, though it ceased to exist following the 2005 \"Decimation\" storyline. The X-Men benefit from advanced technology such as Xavier tracking down mutants with a device called Cerebro which amplifies his powers; the X-Men train within the Danger Room , first depicted as a room full of weapons and booby traps, now as generating holographic simulations; and the X-Men travel in their Blackbird jet .  Fictional places [ edit ]  The X-Men introduced several fictional locations which are regarded as important within the shared universe in which Marvel Comics characters exist:  Asteroid M , an asteroid made by Magneto, a mutant utopia and training facility off of the Earth\\'s surface.  Avalon, Magneto\\'s space station that served as the primary base for him and his Acolytes to create a mutants-only safe haven after Magneto drastically reverted to his villainous ways.  Genosha , an island near Madagascar and a longtime apartheid regime against mutants. The U.N. gave control to Magneto until the E Is for Extinction story saw Genosha destroyed via mass genocide .  Limbo , a hellish dimension heavily populated by demons. Whoever possesses the Soulsword bears control over and can draw power from Limbo. In Extraordinary X-Men , the X-Men made a sanctuary in Limbo called X-Haven their home after Terrigen started making earth uninhabitable for mutants.  Madripoor , an island in South East Asia , near Singapore. Its location is shown to be in the southern portion of the Strait of Malacca , south west of Singapore.  Mojoverse, an alternate dimension ruled by the tyrant Mojo focused on creating violent reality entertainment usually featuring captive mutants  Murderworld , fictional twisted amusement park designed by the Marvel supervillain known as Arcade.  Muir Island , a remote island off the coast of Scotland . This is primarily known in the X-Men universe as the home of Moira MacTaggert \\'s laboratory.  Mutant Town (also known as District X), an area in Alphabet City, Manhattan , populated largely by mutants and beset by poverty and crime.  New Tien, a mutant-run region on the west coast of the United States where mutants outnumber humans. It was created after Hydra took over the United States . Emma Frost secretly leads New Tien by telepathically possessing New Tien\\'s puppet ruler Xorn.  Savage Land , a preserved location in Antarctica which is home to a number of extinct species, most notably dinosaurs , and strange tribes.  Shi\\'ar throneworld Chandilar , the home world of the X-Men\\'s occasional extraterrestrial allies The Shi\\'ar.  Utopia , Cyclops had Asteroid M raised from the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the San Francisco as a response to the rise of anti-mutant sentiment to form a mutant nation.  Other versions [ edit ]  Age of Apocalypse – In a world where Professor X is killed before he can form the X-Men, Magneto leads the X-Men in a dystopian world ruled by Apocalypse. Created and reverted via time travel.  Age of X - a world in which anti-mutant sentiment became even worse due to a series of events and thus led to the United States government hunting down mutants with Sentinels and leading to \"The Decimation\" which severely reduced the mutant population and Magneto leads the mutants who are based in Fortress X.  Days of Future Past – Sentinels have either killed or placed into concentration camps almost all mutants. Prevented by the time-traveling Kate Pryde/Widget (the adult Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat).  House of M – Reality is altered by Scarlet Witch , with her father Magneto as the ruler of Genosha and in which mutants are the dominant group with humans as second-class citizens. 2005\\'s crossover event, it concludes with a reversion to the normal Marvel Universe, albeit with most mutants depowered .  Marvel 1602 – Mutants are known as the \"Witchbreed\" in this alternate reality set during the time of The Inquisition . Carlos Javier creates a \"school for the children of gentlefolk\" to serve as a safe haven and training ground.  Marvel 2099 – Set in a dystopian world with new characters looking to the original X-Men as history, becoming X-Men 2099 and X-Nation 2099 .  Marvel Noir - The X-Men of this reality are a group of delinquent teenagers led by Charles Xavier who believes that sociopathy is the next step in human evolution.  Mutant X – Set in a world where Scott Summers was captured along with his parents by the Shi\\'ar and only Alex escaped, allowing him to be the eventual leader of this Universe\\'s X-Men (\"The Six\"). The Mutant X universe reimagines Mr. Fantastic , Nick Fury , and Professor X as villains and Doctor Doom and Apocalypse as heroes.  MC2 - In this alternate future, Jubilee forms the X-People in response to anti-mutant sentiment. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] Members include Angry Eagle, Simian, Spanner, Torque, Push , Bluestreak , J2 , and Wild Thing . [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Time-displaced X-Men - The time-displaced team was introduced as such in All-New X-Men vol. 1 #1, by Brian Michael Bendis and Stuart Immonen , and brought to the present with time travel. They were kept as regular characters, as Bendis intended to explore their reactions to the fate of their adult selves. [41] The team was the main focus of the Battle of the Atom crossover, some months later. Bendis also used them for crossovers with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Miles Morales , that he also wrote. [42] This was one of the few crossovers between the Marvel Universe and the Ultimate Marvel universe; Bendis preferred to write them sparingly. [43]  All-New X-Men has a vol. 2 in 2015, by Dennis Hopeless and Mark Bagley . [44] The comic was cancelled after the end of the Inhumans vs. X-Men crossover, and the team was now published in the X-Men Blue comic. The teenager Jean also got a solo series after the end of ResurrXion , by Hopeless and Victor Ibanez, that explored her relation with the Phoenix Force . [45] The teenager Cyclops joins the Champions , a comic book focused on teenager heroes but unrelated to the X-Men mythos. [46] They guest-starred in the Venom comic, in the \"Poison-X\" arc. The story took the villains from the Venomverse arc and led to the Venomized crossover. [47] The team will be featured in the Extermination crossover. [48]  Ruins - Although the actual X-Men don\\'t appear alternate versions of its members and villains are shown to have suffered under horrific circumstances. Charles Xavier is a tyrannical President of the United States , Jean Grey is a prostitute , Magneto and Mystique die, Wolverine suffers from poisoning from his adamantium skeleton, Emma Frost heads the Church of the Next Generation and forces children of her followers to undergo surgery, Cyclops as well as Nightcrawler and Kitty Pryde are imprisoned at a Texas jail and Sabretooth is part of a fascist cannibalistic militia based in Oklahoma alongside Bucky Barnes and Jack Monroe.  Ultimate X-Men – Set in the reimagined Ultimate Marvel universe. The X-Men are younger, wear black and gold uniforms and supernatural/cosmic elements are downplayed. Additionally Colossus is gay unlike his main universe counterpart, Magneto is not a Holocaust survivor and is more villainous, mutants were created by the Super-Soldier Serum, Cable is Wolverine and Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat dated Spider-Man.  X-Men Forever – An alternate continuity diverging from X-Men , vol. 2 #3, continuing as though writer Chris Claremont had never left writing the series. [49]  X-Men Noir – Set in the 1930s, with the X-Men as a mysterious criminal gang and the Brotherhood as a secret society of corrupt cops.  X-Men: The End – A possible ending to the X-Men\\'s early 2005 status quo.  X-Men \\'92 – Follows \"Secret Wars\", the X-Men of the 1992 TV Series, received their own comic book series. [50]  Reflecting social issues [ edit ]  The conflict between mutants and normal humans is often compared to real-world conflicts experienced by minority groups in America such as African Americans , various religious or non-religious groups, ( Muslims , those with autism , the LGBTQ community , etc.) [51] [52] It has been remarked that attitudes towards mutants do not make sense in the context of the Marvel Universe, since non-mutants with similar powers are rarely regarded with fear; X-Men editor Ann Nocenti remarked that \"I think that\\'s literary, really - because there is no difference between Colossus and the Torch . If a guy comes into my office in flames, or a guy comes into my office and turns to steel, I\\'m going to have the same reaction. It doesn\\'t really matter that I know their origins. ... as a book, The X-Men has always represented something different - their powers arrive at puberty, making them analogous to the changes you go through at adolescence - whether they\\'re special, or out of control, or setting you apart - the misfit identity theme.\" [53] Also on an individual level, a number of X-Men serve a metaphorical function as their powers illustrate points about the nature of the outsider.  .mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:0.5em 1.4em 0.8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:0.5em 0 0.8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{margin:0.5em auto 0.8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft p,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright p{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{background-color:#F9F9F9;text-align:center;font-size:larger;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" “ \";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" ” \";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:640px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{width:100%!important;margin:0 0 0.8em!important;float:none!important}}  The X-Men are hated, feared and despised collectively by humanity for no other reason than that they are mutants. So what we have here, intended or not, is a book that is about racism, bigotry and prejudice.  — Uncanny X-Men writer Chris Claremont , 1981    Racism : Although this was not initially the case, Professor X has come to be compared to civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. and Magneto to the more militant Malcolm X . [54] [55] [56] The X-Men\\'s purpose is sometimes referred to as achieving \"Xavier\\'s dream\", perhaps a reference to King\\'s historic \" I Have a Dream \" speech. [57] (Magneto, in the first film , quotes Malcolm X with the line \" By any means necessary .\") X-Men comic books have often portrayed mutants as victims of mob violence , evoking images of the lynching of African Americans in the age before the civil rights movement . [58] Sentinels and anti-mutant hate groups such as Friends of Humanity , Humanity\\'s Last Stand, the Church of Humanity , and Stryker\\'s  Purifiers are thought to often represent oppressive forces like the Ku Klux Klan giving a form to denial of civil rights and amendments. [59] In the 1980s, the comic featured a plot involving the fictional island nation of Genosha , where mutants are segregated and enslaved by an apartheid state. This is widely interpreted as a reference to the situation in South Africa at the time. [60]  Anti-Semitism : Explicitly referenced in recent decades is the comparison between antimutant sentiment and anti-Semitism. Magneto, a Holocaust survivor, sees the situation of mutants as similar to those of Jews in Nazi Germany . [55] [61] At one point he even utters the words \"never again\" in a 1992 episode of the X-Men animated series. The mutant slave labor camps on the island of Genosha , in which numbers were burned into mutant\\'s foreheads, show much in common with Nazi concentration camps , [61] [62] [63] as do the internment camps of the classic \" Days of Future Past \" storyline. [64] In the third X-Men film, when asked by Callisto: \"If you\\'re so proud of being a mutant, then where\\'s your mark?\" Magneto shows his concentration camp tattoo, while mentioning that he will never let another needle touch his skin. In the prequel film X-Men: First Class , a fourteen-year-old Magneto suffers Nazi human experimentation during his time in the camps and witnesses his mother\\'s death by gunshot.  Diversity : Characters within the X-Men mythos hail from a wide variety of nationalities. These characters also reflect religious, ethnic or sexual minorities. Examples include Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat, Magneto and Sabra who are of Jewish descent . Dust and M who are Muslim , Nightcrawler who is a devout Catholic . Neal Shaara/Thunderbird who is Hindu . Jubilee is Chinese American , Gambit is born to Cajun parents from New Orleans, Louisiana and Rogue is from Caledecott County, Mississippi both of whom are Southerners . Warpath along with his deceased brother the first Thunderbird are Native Americans of Apache descent . Storm represents two aspects of the African diaspora as her father was African American and her mother was Kenyan . Karma was portrayed as a devout Catholic from Vietnam , who regularly attended Mass and confession when she was introduced as a founding member of the New Mutants . [65] This team also included Wolfsbane (a devout Scottish  Presbyterian ), Danielle Moonstar (a Native American of Cheyenne descent ), Cannonball , and was later joined by Magma (a devout Greco-Roman classical religionist). Different nationalities included Wolverine, Aurora , Northstar , Deadpool and Transonic from Canada ; Colossus and Magik from Russia ; Banshee and Siryn from Ireland ; Dust from Afghanistan ; Psylocke, Wolfsbane and Chamber from the United Kingdom ; Sunfire, Armor , Surge and Zero from Japan ; Sunspot from Brazil ; M from Monaco ; Nightcrawler from Germany ; Sabra from Israel ; Omega Sentinel , Neal Shaara, Kavita Rao and Indra from India ; Velocidad from Mexico ; Oya from Nigeria ; Primal from Ukraine ; etc. [59] [66] [67]  LGBT themes : Some commentators have noted the similarities between the struggles of mutants and the LGBT community, noting the onset of special powers around puberty and the parallels between being closeted and the mutants\\' concealment of their powers. [68] In the comics series, gay and bisexual characters include Anole , Bling! , Destiny, Karma, Mystique, Psylocke, Courier, Northstar (whose marriage was depicted in the comics in 2012), Graymalkin , Rictor , Shatterstar , Shade, the Ultimate version of Colossus and later Iceman after revealing that he is a mutant; the comics version of the character was then revealed to be gay in 2015. Transgender issues also come up with shapechangers like Mystique, Copycat , and Courier who can change gender at will. It has been said that the comic books and the X-Men animated series delved into the AIDS epidemic with a long-running plot line about the Legacy Virus , a seemingly incurable disease thought at first to attack only mutants (similar to the AIDS virus which at first was spread through the gay community). [69] In the film X-Men: First Class ,  Hank McCoy is asked by his CIA boss why he never disclosed his mutant identity, and his response was \"you didn\\'t ask, I didn\\'t tell\" .  Communism and socialism : Occasionally, undercurrents of the real-life \" Red Scare \" are present or the events of the Red Scare in history are alluded to. Senator Robert Kelly\\'s proposal of a Mutant Registration Act is similar to the efforts of United States Congress to try to ban communism in the United States. [63] In the 2000 X-Men film, Kelly exclaims, \"We must know who these mutants are and what they can do,\" even brandishing a \"list\" of known mutants (a reference to Senator Joseph McCarthy \\'s list of Communist Party USA members who were working in the government). [70]  Religion : Religion is an integral part of several X-Men storylines. It is presented as both a positive and negative force, sometimes in the same story. The comics explore religious fundamentalism through the person of William Stryker and his Purifiers, an antimutant group that emerged in the 1982 graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills . The Purifiers believe that mutants are not human beings but children of the devil, and have attempted to exterminate them several times, most recently in the \"Childhood\\'s End\" storyline. By contrast, religion is also central to the lives of several X-Men, such as Nightcrawler, a devout Catholic , and Dust , a devout Sunni Muslim who wears an Islamic niqāb . [66]  Subculture : In some cases, the mutants of the X-Men universe sought to create a subculture of the typical mutant society portrayed. The Morlocks, though mutants like those attending Xavier\\'s school, hide away from society within the tunnels of New York. These Morlock tunnels serve as the backdrop for several X-Men stories, most notably The Mutant Massacre crossover. This band of mutants illustrates another dimension to the comic, that of a group that further needs to isolate itself because society won\\'t accept it. [71] [72] In Grant Morrison \\'s stories of the early 2000s, mutants are portrayed as a distinct subculture with \"mutant bands,\" mutant use of code-names as their primary form of self-identity (rather than their given birth names), and a popular mutant fashion designer who created outfits tailored to mutant physiology . The series District X takes place in an area of New York City called \"Mutant Town.\" [60] These instances can also serve as analogies for the way that minority groups establish subcultures and neighborhoods of their own that distinguish them from the broader general culture. Director Bryan Singer has remarked that the X-Men franchise has served as a metaphor for acceptance of all people for their special and unique gifts. The mutant condition that is often kept secret from the world can be analogous to feelings of difference and fear usually developed in everyone during adolescence. [ citation needed ]  Genocide : Genocide and its psychological after-effects, primarily survivor guilt , are recurring elements in some of the most significant X-Men story arcs. Magneto was a survivor of The Holocaust and witnessed the genocide of his people, severely scarring him emotionally and leaving him with a strong distrust of humanity. Because of this he constantly toes the line between ally and enemy of the X-Men. The iconic Days of Future Past story line saw an alternate future where Sentinels committed genocide on most of the world\\'s mutants. [73] In Rachel Summers\\' original timeline, she was captured by humans and turned into a \\'hound\\' used to hunt down other mutants in order to capture and kill them, leaving her extremely traumatized by the experience and knowledge that she unwittingly assisted in the genocide of her own people. Bishop\\'s childhood consisted of him being trapped in a mutant concentration camp, leaving him so emotionally scarred as an adult that upon returning to the past he was prepared to kill a baby who might have caused his future . When Cassandra Nova committed genocide on Genosha, the event left both Emma Frost [74] and Polaris [75] [76] traumatized by survivors guilt as they were amongst the limited few survivors. While taking some time off in Germany, Nightcrawler witnessed the genocide of numerous mutants. The event left him as an emotional shell of who he used to be because of the trauma of what he witnessed until he had psychic therapy with Jean to help him cope. [77] Other characters who have either committed or have survived genocide include Mystique, Callisto , Apocalypse, Onslaught, Bastion , Mister Sinister , Hope Summers, Cable, and the Phoenix Force .  Cultural impact [ edit ]  The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel\\'s early 1960s comic books such as The Fantastic Four , The Amazing Spider-Man , The Incredible Hulk , and X-Men ushered in a new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public\\'s perception of superheroes. [78]   In other media [ edit ]  Main article: X-Men in other media  The X-Men team has featured in multiple forms of media including a live-action film series , multiple animated shows , live-action shows, multiple video games , numerous novels , motion comics , soundtracks , action figures , and clothing .  See also [ edit ]  List of Marvel Comics superhero debuts  Doom Patrol , a similar team of super-powered misfits appearing in comics published by DC Comics .

       " 'Fantastic Four': 'Comic book superhero team  This article is about the superhero team. For other uses, see Fantastic Four (disambiguation) .  Fantastic Four Promotional art for Fantastic Four: The Lost Adventure #1 (Feb. 2008) by Jack Kirby , repurposed from his 1970s Marvelmania poster. Depicting Mister Fantastic , Invisible Woman , the Thing and the Human Torch . Publication information Publisher Marvel Comics First appearance The Fantastic Four #1 (November 1961 ) Created by Stan Lee (writer) Jack Kirby (artist) In-story information Base(s)  Baxter Building  Avengers Mansion (formerly)  Four Freedoms Plaza  Pier 4  4 Yancy St.  Member(s)  Mister Fantastic  Invisible Woman  Human Torch  Thing  Roster See: List of Fantastic Four members  The Fantastic Four are a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . They debuted in The Fantastic Four #1 ( cover dated Nov. 1961), helping usher in a new level of realism in the medium. They were the first superhero team created by artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby and editor/co-plotter Stan Lee , who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this title. The four characters traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four, who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a scientific mission to outer space, are: Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), a scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes; the Invisible Woman (Susan \"Sue\" Storm), who eventually married Reed, who can render herself invisible and later project powerful invisible force fields; the Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue\\'s younger brother, who can generate flames, surround himself with them and fly; the monstrous Thing (Ben Grimm), their grumpy but benevolent friend, a former college football star, Reed\\'s college roommate and a good pilot, who possesses tremendous superhuman strength, durability and endurance due to his stone-like flesh. Since their 1961 introduction, the Fantastic Four have been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional, yet loving, family. Breaking convention with other comic archetypes, they squabbled, held grudges both deep and petty, and eschewed anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status.

[note 1] While film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan has debunked the particulars of that story, [note 2] Goodman, a publishing trend-follower, aware of the JLA\\'s strong sales, did direct his comics editor, Stan Lee , to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee, writing in 1974, \"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called The [ sic ] Justice League of America and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... \\'If the Justice League is selling\\', spoke he, \\'why don\\'t we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?\\'\" [1] : 16  Lee, who had served as editor-in-chief and art director of Marvel Comics and its predecessor companies, Timely Comics and Atlas Comics , for two decades, found that the medium had become creatively restrictive. Determined \"to carve a real career for myself in the nowhere world of comic books\", [note 3] Lee concluded that, \"For just this once, I would do the type of story I myself would enjoy reading.... And the characters would be the kind of characters I could personally relate to: they\\'d be flesh and blood, they\\'d have their faults and foibles, they\\'d be fallible and feisty, and — most important of all — inside their colorful, costumed booties they\\'d still have feet of clay.\" [1] : 17  Lee provided one of his earliest recorded comments on the creation of the Fantastic Four for a fanzine in 1968, during which time Jack Kirby was also working at Marvel (Kirby himself is interviewed separately in the same publication). When asked who conceived the team, him or Kirby, Lee responded \"Both – \\'twas mainly my idea, but Jack created characters visually\". [2] In the 1974 book Origins of Marvel Comics Lee described the creative process in more detail, stating that he developed the basic characters as well as a story synopsis for the first issue penciller  Jack Kirby to follow. Lee noted the involvement of both Kirby and Publisher Martin Goodman prior to preparing his synopsis: \"After kicking it around with Martin and Jack for a while I decided to call our quaint quartet the Fantastic Four.  I wrote a detailed first synopsis for Jack to follow and the rest is history.\" [1] : 18 Kirby turned in his penciled art pages to Lee, who added dialogue and captions. This approach to creating comics, which became known as the \" Marvel Method \", worked so well that Lee and Kirby used it from then on, and the Marvel Method became standard for the company within a year. [3] : 87  Kirby recalled events somewhat differently. In a 1970 Fanzine interview he confirmed Lee\\'s involvement in the creation of the Fantastic Four but took credit for the main characters and ideas, stating \"It was my idea. It was my idea to do it the way it was; my idea to develop it the way it was.  I\\'m not saying Stan had nothing to do with it.  Of course he did.  We talked things out.\" [4] Years later, when specifically challenged with Lee\\'s version of events in a 1990 interview, Kirby responded: \"I would say that\\'s an outright lie\", [5] : 39 although the interviewer, Gary Groth , notes that this statement needs to be viewed with caution. [note 4] Kirby claims he came up with the idea for the Fantastic Four in Marvel\\'s offices, and that Lee merely added the dialogue after the story was pencilled. [5] : 38 Kirby also sought to establish, more credibly and on numerous occasions, that the visual elements of the strip were his conceptions. He regularly pointed to a team he created for rival publisher DC Comics in the 1950s, the Challengers of the Unknown . \"[I]f you notice the uniforms, they\\'re the same... I always give them a skintight uniform with a belt... the Challengers and the FF have a minimum of decoration. And of course, the Thing\\'s skin is a kind of decoration, breaking up the monotony of the blue uniform.\" [6] : 4 It is important to note, however, that the Fantastic Four originally wore civilian garb instead of uniforms, which were only introduced (along with the Baxter Building Headquarters) in the third issue of the series following readership feedback. [7] The original submitted design was also modified to include the iconic chest insignia of a \"4\" within a circle that was designed by Lee. [8]  Given the conflicting statements, outside commentators have found it hard to ascertain who created the Fantastic Four. A typed synopsis by Lee for the introductory segment of the first Fantastic Four issue exists and outlines the characters and their origins, with various minor differences to the published version. However Earl Wells, writing in The Comics Journal , points out that its existence does not assert its place in the creation: \"[W]e have no way of knowing of whether Lee wrote the synopsis after a discussion with Kirby in which Kirby supplied most of the ideas\". [9] : 78  It is also notable that the Fantastic Four\\'s first adventure in 1961 depicts a team of four adventurers (three men and a woman) led by a Professor travelling to the Earth’s centre and encountering giant monsters while contending with a human protagonist who is also from the surface world. [10] These are elements present in the very successful Journey to the Centre of the Earth 1959 film . [11] Although neither Lee nor Kirby ever mentioned the movie as a direct inspiration, publisher Martin Goodman was well known for following popular entertainment trends to attract sales in his comics line. [12]  Comics historian R. C. Harvey believes the Fantastic Four was a continuation of the work Kirby previously did, and so \"more likely Kirby\\'s creations than Lee\\'s\". [13] : 69 But Harvey notes that the Marvel Method of collaboration allowed each man to claim credit, [13] : 68 and that Lee\\'s dialogue added to the direction the team took. [13] : 69 Wells argues that Lee\\'s contributions set the framework within which Kirby worked, and this made Lee \"more responsible\". [9] : 85 Comics historian Mark Evanier , a studio assistant to Jack Kirby in the 1970s, says that the considered opinion of Lee and Kirby\\'s contemporaries was \"that Fantastic Four was created by Stan and Jack. No further division of credit seemed appropriate.\" [14] : 122   1961–1970s [ edit ]  The release of The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961) was an unexpected success. Lee had felt ready to leave the comics field at the time, but the positive response to Fantastic Four persuaded him to stay on. [15] The title began to receive fan mail [16] and Lee started printing the letters in a letter column with issue #3. Also with the third issue, Lee created the hyperbolic slogan \"The Greatest Comic Magazine in the World!!\" With the following issue, the slogan was changed to \"The World\\'s Greatest Comic Magazine!\" and became a fixture on the issue covers into the 1990s, [3] : 87 and on numerous covers in the 2000s. Issue #4 (May 1962) reintroduced Namor the Sub-Mariner , [17] an aquatic antihero who was a star character of Marvel\\'s earliest iteration, Timely Comics , during the late 1930s and 1940s period that historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comics . Issue #5 (July 1962) introduced the team\\'s most frequent nemesis, Doctor Doom . [18] These earliest issues were published bimonthly. With issue #16 (July 1963), the cover title dropped its The and became simply Fantastic Four . While the early stories were complete narratives, the frequent appearances of these two antagonists, Doom and Namor, in subsequent issues indicated the creation of a long narrative by Lee and Kirby that extended over months. According to comics historian Les Daniels , \"only narratives that ran to several issues would be able to contain their increasingly complex ideas\". [3] : 88 During its creators\\' lengthy run, the series produced many acclaimed storylines and characters that have become central to Marvel, including the hidden race of alien-human genetic experiments, the Inhumans ; [19] [20] the Black Panther , [21] an African king who would be mainstream comics\\' first black superhero; [22] the rival alien races the Kree and the shapeshifting Skrulls ; [23] Him, who would become Adam Warlock ; [24] the Negative Zone and unstable molecules . The story frequently cited as Lee and Kirby\\'s finest achievement [25] [26] is the three-part \" Galactus Trilogy \" that began in Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966), chronicling the arrival of Galactus , a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet, and his herald, the Silver Surfer . [27] [28]  Fantastic Four #48 was chosen as #24 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel\\'s readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that, \"As the fourth year of the Fantastic Four came to a close, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby seemed to be only warming up. In retrospect, it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the Marvel Age.\" [29] Daniels noted that \"[t]he mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the 1960s\", and Lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses. [3] : 128 The Fantastic Four Annual was used to spotlight several key events. The Sub-Mariner was crowned king of Atlantis in the first annual (1963). [30] The following year\\'s annual revealed the origin story of Doctor Doom. [31]  Fantastic Four Annual #3 (1965) presented the wedding of Reed Richards and Sue Storm. [32] Lee and Kirby reintroduced the original Human Torch in Fantastic Four Annual #4 (1966) and had him battle Johnny Storm. [33] Sue Richards\\' pregnancy was announced in Fantastic Four Annual #5 (1967), and the Richards\\' son, Franklin Richards was born in Fantastic Four Annual #6 (1968) [34] in a story which introduced Annihilus as well. [35]  Marvel filed for a trademark for \"Fantastic Four\" in 1967 and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the registration in 1970. [36]  Kirby left Marvel in mid-1970, [37] having drawn the first 102 issues plus an unfinished issue, partially published in Fantastic Four #108, with alterations, and later completed and published as Fantastic Four: The Lost Adventure (April 2008), Fantastic Four continued with Lee, Roy Thomas , [38]  Gerry Conway and Marv Wolfman as its consecutive regular writers, working with artists such as John Romita Sr. , John Buscema , Rich Buckler and George Pérez , with longtime inker Joe Sinnott adding some visual continuity. Jim Steranko also contributed some covers during this time. A short-lived series starring the team, Giant-Size Super-Stars , began in May 1974 and changed its title to Giant-Size Fantastic Four with issue #2. [39] The fourth issue introduced Jamie Madrox , a character who later became part of the X-Men . [40]  Giant-Size Fantastic Four was canceled with issue #6 (Oct. 1975). [41] Roy Thomas and George Pérez crafted a metafictional story for Fantastic Four #176 (Nov. 1976) in which the Impossible Man visited the offices of Marvel Comics and met numerous comics creators . [42] Marv Wolfman and Keith Pollard crafted a multi-issue storyline involving the son of Doctor Doom which culminated in issue #200 (Nov. 1978). [43]  John Byrne joined the title with issue #209 (Aug. 1979), doing pencil breakdowns for Sinnott to finish. He and Wolfman introduced a new herald for Galactus named Terrax the Tamer in #211 (Oct. 1979). [44]   1980s and 1990s [ edit ]  Bill Mantlo briefly followed Wolfman as writer of the series and wrote a crossover with Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #42 (May 1980). [45] [46] [47] Byrne wrote and drew a giant-sized Fantastic Four promotional comic for Coca-Cola , which was rejected by Coca-Cola as being too violent and published as Fantastic Four #220–221 (July–Aug. 1980) instead. [48] Writer Doug Moench and penciller Bill Sienkiewicz then took over for 10 issues. With issue #232 (July 1981), the aptly titled \"Back to the Basics\", [49] Byrne began his run as writer, penciller and inker, the last under the pseudonym Bjorn Heyn for this issue only. [50]  Byrne revitalized the slumping title with his run. [51] : 265 Originally, Byrne was slated to write with Sienkiewicz providing the art. Sienkiewicz left to do Moon Knight , and Byrne subsequently became writer, artist, and inker. Various editors were assigned to the comic; eventually Bob Budiansky became the regular editor. Byrne told Jim Shooter that he could not work with Budiansky, although they ultimately continued to work together. In 2006, Byrne said \"that\\'s my paranoia. I look back and I think that was Shooter trying to force me off the book\". Byrne left following issue #293 (Aug. 1986) in the middle of a story arc, explaining he could not recapture the fun he had previously had on the series. [52] One of Byrne\\'s changes was making the Invisible Girl into the Invisible Woman: [53] assertive and confident. During this period, fans came to recognize that she was quite powerful, whereas previously, she had been primarily seen as a superpowered mother and wife in the tradition of television moms like those played by Donna Reed and Florence Henderson . [54]  Byrne staked new directions in the characters\\' personal lives, having the married Sue Storm and Reed Richards suffer a miscarriage and the Thing quitting the Fantastic Four, with She-Hulk being recruited as his long-term replacement. He also re-emphasized the family dynamic which he felt the series had drifted away from after the Lee/Kirby run, commenting that, \" Family —and not dysfunctional family —is the central, key element to the FF. It is an absolutely vital dynamic between the characters.\" [emphases in original] [48]  Byrne was followed by a quick succession of writers: Roger Stern , Tom DeFalco , and Roy Thomas . Steve Englehart took over as writer for issues 304–332 (except #320). The title had been struggling, so Englehart decided to make radical changes. He felt the title had become stale with the normal makeup of Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny, so in issue #308 Reed and Sue retired and were replaced with the Thing\\'s new girlfriend, Sharon Ventura , and Johnny Storm\\'s former love, Crystal. The changes increased readership through issue #321. At this point, Marvel made decisions about another Englehart comic, West Coast Avengers , that he disagreed with, and in protest he changed his byline to S.F.X. Englehart (S.F.X. is the abbreviation for Simple Sound Effects). In issue #326, Englehart was told to bring Reed and Sue back and undo the other changes he had made. This caused Englehart to take his name entirely off the book. He used the pseudonym John Harkness, which he had created years before for work he didn\\'t want to be associated with. According to Englehart, the run from #326 through his last issue, #332, was \"one of the most painful stretches of [his] career.\" [55] Writer-artist Walt Simonson took over as writer with #334 (December 1989), and three issues later began pencilling and inking as well. With brief inking exceptions, two fill-in issues, and a three-issue stint drawn by Arthur Adams , [56] [57] Simonson remained in all three positions through #354 (July 1991). Simonson, who had been writing the team comic The Avengers , had gotten approval for Reed and Sue to join that team after Engelhart had written them out of Fantastic Four . Yet by The Avengers #300, where they were scheduled to join the team, Simonson was told the characters were returning to Fantastic Four . This led to Simonson quitting The Avengers after that issue. Shortly afterward, he was offered the job of writing Fantastic Four . Having already prepared a number of stories involving the Avengers with Reed and Sue in the lineup, he then rewrote these for Fantastic Four . Simonson later recalled that working on Fantastic Four allowed him the latitude to use original Avengers members Thor and Iron Man , which he had been precluded from using in The Avengers . [58]  After another fill-in, the regular team of writer and Marvel editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco , penciller Paul Ryan and inker Dan Bulanadi took over, with Ryan self-inking beginning with #360 (Jan. 1992). That team, with the very occasional different inker, continued for years through #414 (July 1996). DeFalco nullified the Storm-Masters marriage by retconning that the alien Skrull Empire had kidnapped the real Masters and replaced her with a spy named Lyja . Once discovered, Lyja, who herself had fallen for Storm, helped the Fantastic Four rescue Masters. Ventura departed after being further mutated by Doctor Doom. Although some fans were not pleased with DeFalco\\'s run on Fantastic Four , calling him \"The Great Satan\", the title\\'s sales rose steadily over the period. [59] [60]  Other key developments included Franklin Richards being sent into the future and returning as a teenager; the return of Reed\\'s time-traveling father, Nathaniel, who is revealed to be the father of time-travelling villain Kang the Conqueror and Reed\\'s apparent death at the hands of a seemingly mortally wounded Doctor Doom. [61] It would be two years before DeFalco resurrected the two characters, revealing that their \"deaths\" were orchestrated by the supervillain Hyperstorm . The ongoing series was canceled with issue #416 (Sept. 1996) and relaunched with vol. 2 #1 (Nov. 1996) as part of the multi-series \" Heroes Reborn \" crossover story arc. The yearlong volume retold the team\\'s first adventures in a more contemporary style, [62] and set in a parallel universe. Following the end of that experiment, Fantastic Four was relaunched with vol. 3 #1 (Jan. 1998). Initially by the team of writer Scott Lobdell and penciller Alan Davis , [63] it went after three issues to writer Chris Claremont (co-writing with Lobdell for #4–5) and penciller Salvador Larroca ; this team enjoyed a long run through issue #32 (Aug. 2000).  2000s [ edit ]  Following the run of Claremont, Lobdell and Larroca, Carlos Pacheco took over as penciller and co-writer, first with Rafael Marín , then with Marín and Jeph Loeb . This series began using dual numbering, as if the original Fantastic Four series had continued unbroken, with issue #42 / #471 (June 2001). At the time, the Marvel Comics series begun in the 1960s, such as Thor and The Amazing Spider-Man , were given such dual numbering on the front cover, with the present-day volume\\'s numbering alongside the numbering from the original series. After issue #70 / #499 (Aug. 2003), the title reverted to its original vol. 1 numbering with issue #500 (Sept. 2003). Karl Kesel succeeded Loeb as co-writer with issue #51 / #480 (March 2002), and after a few issues with temporary teams, Mark Waid took over as writer with #60 / 489 (October 2002) with artist Mike Wieringo with Marvel releasing a promotional variant edition of their otherwise $2.25 debut issue at the price of nine cents US. [64] [65] Pencillers Mark Buckingham , Casey Jones, and Howard Porter variously contributed through issue #524 (May 2005), with a handful of issues by other teams also during this time. Writer J. Michael Straczynski and penciller Mike McKone did issues #527–541 (July 2005 – Nov. 2006), with Dwayne McDuffie taking over as writer the following issue, and Paul Pelletier succeeding McKone beginning with #544 (May 2007). As a result of the events of the \" Civil War \" company-crossover storyline, the Black Panther and Storm temporarily replaced Reed and Susan Richards on the team. During that period, the Fantastic Four also appeared in Black Panther , [66] [67] written by Reginald Hudlin and pencilled primarily by Francis Portela. Beginning with issue #554 (April 2008), writer Mark Millar and penciller Bryan Hitch began what Marvel announced as a sixteen-issue run. [68] [69] Following the summer 2008 crossover storyline, \" Secret Invasion \", and the 2009 aftermath \" Dark Reign \", chronicling the U.S. government\\'s assigning of the Nation\\'s security functions to the seemingly reformed supervillain Norman Osborn , the Fantastic Four starred in a five-issue miniseries , Dark Reign: Fantastic Four (May–Sept. 2009), written by Jonathan Hickman , with art by Sean Chen . [70] [71] [72] Hickman took over as the series regular writer as of issue #570 with Dale Eaglesham [73] and later Steve Epting on art.  2010s [ edit ]  In the storyline \"Three\", which concluded in Fantastic Four #587 ( cover date March 2011, published January 26, 2011), the Human Torch appears to die stopping a horde of monsters from the other-dimensional Negative Zone . The series ended with the following issue, #588, and relaunched in March 2011 as simply FF . [74] [75] [76] The relaunch saw the team assume a new name, the Future Foundation , adopt new black-and-white costumes, and accept longtime ally Spider-Man as a member. [77] [78] [79] In October 2011, with the publication of FF #11 (cover-dated Dec. 2011), the Fantastic Four series reached its 599th issue. In November 2011, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Fantastic Four and of Marvel Comics, the company published the 100-page Fantastic Four #600 (cover-dated Jan. 2012), [80] which returned the title to its original numbering and featured the return of the Human Torch. It revealed the fate of the character of Johnny Storm after issue #587, showing that while he did in fact die, he was resurrected to fight as a gladiator for the entertainment of Annihilus. Storm later formed a resistance force called Light Brigade and defeated Annihilus. [81]  Although it was launched as a continuation of the Fantastic Four title, FF continues publication as a separate series. Starting with issue #12, the title focuses upon the youthful members of the Future Foundation, including Franklin and Valeria Richards. In the graphic novel Fantastic Four: Season One , the Fantastic Four is given an updated origin story set in the present day instead of the 1960s. [82] The hardcover compilation debuted at number four on The New York Times Best Seller list for graphic novels. [82]  As part of Marvel NOW!  Fantastic Four ended with #611, ending Jonathan Hickman\\'s long run on FF titles, and the title was relaunched in November 2012 with the creative team of writer Matt Fraction and artist Mark Bagley . [83] [84] In the new title with its numbering starting at #1, the entire Fantastic Four family explore space together, with the hidden intent for Reed Richards to discover why his powers are fading. Writer James Robinson and artist Leonard Kirk launched a new Fantastic Four series in February 2014 ( cover dated April 2014). [85]  Robinson later confirmed that Fantastic Four would be cancelled in 2015 with issue #645, saying that \"The book is reverting to its original numbers, and the book is going away for a while. I\\'m moving towards the end of Fantastic Four . I just want to reassure people that you will not leave this book with a bad taste in your mouth.\" [86] In the aftermath of the \" Secret Wars \" storyline, the Thing is working with the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Human Torch is acting as an ambassador with the Inhumans. [87] With Franklin\\'s powers restored and Reed having absorbed the power of the Beyonders from Doom, the Richards family is working on travelling through and reconstructing the multiverse, [88] but Peter Parker has purchased the Baxter Building to keep it \"safe\" until the team is ready to come back together. [89]  A new volume for the Fantastic Four was released in August 2018, written by Dan Slott , as part of Marvel\\'s Fresh Start event. [90] [91] The first issue of the new series was met with strong sales, [92] and a positive critical reaction. [92] [93] [94] [95] When the Future Foundation is threatened by the Griever at the End of All Things, Mister Fantastic plays on her ego to convince her to provide him with equipment that will allow him to summon his teammates. When Human Torch and Thing are reunited with Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman, the other superheroes that were part of the Fantastic Four at some point in their lives also arrived, including unexpectedly, X-Men \\'s Iceman . [96] With the gathered heroes assisted the Fantastic Four into causing so much damage to the Griever\\'s equipment, she is forced to retreat in her final telepod or be trapped in that universe. This left the heroes to salvage components from the broken ship to create their own teleport system to return to their universe. [97] The Fantastic Four and their extended family returned to Earth where they find that Liberteens members Ms. America, 2-D, Hope, and Iceberg have come together as the Fantastix with Ms. America taking the codename of Ms. Fantastix. Following the staged bank robbery that the Wrecking Crew committed and their involvement of being hired to humiliate the Fantastix in public, the Fantastic Four gave the Fantastix their blessing to continue using the Baxter Building while the FF operate in a house on Yancy Street with a dimensionally-transcendental interior. [98]  In the storyline Point of Origin , the Fantastic Four entrust Alicia, H.E.R.B.I.E. Franklin and Valerie to protect Earth while they begin their mission to learn a further origin of the cosmic radiation that granted them their powers in the first place, piloting a new space ship called Marvel-2. [99] While in a middle of space adventure to find the origin behind their super power results from a cosmic ray, the Fantastic Four are attacked by a group who believed themselves to be the superheroes of Planet Spyre, the Unparalleled . As both Reed and Sue got separated from the Thing, while Human Torch is revealed to be the soulmate of the Unparalleled member named Sky, they learned the Unparalleled\\'s leader and the Overseer of Planet Spyre, Revos was responsible for the cosmic rays that struck the team on their original trip as he wanted to stop them coming to his planet, and subsequently mutated his people to \\'prepare for their return\\' before trying to eradicate the mutates who are unable to retain their original forms in the same manner as the Thing, accusing the mutates of being \"villains and imperfects\"; as a result, through his own paranoia and xenophobia, the Overseer himself is responsible for the fateful creation of the Fantastic Four and mutated his entire race to face a non-existent threat. [100] Revos challenges Mr. Fantastic for a fight over their differences, until it has settled and they finally made peace. As the Fantastic Four are about to depart Spyre after helping its citizens clean up the Planet (as well as Reed providing the mutates with a variation of the temporary \\'cure\\' he has created for Ben), Skye join them to learn about Earth and every unseen galaxy. [101] When the incoming Kree-Skrull Empyre occur at the same time when the teen heroes being outlawed , the original Fantastic Four went to space with Avengers to stop this Empyre, leaving Franklin and Valerie being backed by Spider-Man and Wolverine to defend Earth. [102]   Spinoffs [ edit ]  Ancillary titles and features spun off from the flagship series include the 1970s quarterly Giant-Size Fantastic Four and the 1990s Fantastic Four Unlimited and Fantastic Four Unplugged ; Fantastic Force , an 18-issue spinoff (November 1994 – April 1996) featuring an adult Franklin Richards, from a different timeline, as Psi-Lord. A 12-issue series Fantastic Four: The World\\'s Greatest Comics Magazine ran in 2001, paying homage to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby \\'s legendary run. A spinoff title Marvel Knights 4 (April 2004 – August 2006) was written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and initially illustrated by Steve McNiven [103] in his first Marvel work. There have also been numerous limited series featuring the group. In 1996, Marvel launched the series Fantastic Four 2099 , part of the company\\'s Marvel 2099 imprint which explored an alternate future of the Marvel Universe. The four protagonists inexplicably find themselves in 2099, with the world believing them to be clones of the original members of the Fantastic Four. The series ran for 8 issues (Jan. – Aug. 1996), serving as a companion to Doom 2099 —an original Marvel 2099 title featuring an individual claiming to be the original Victor von Doom . In 2004, Marvel launched Ultimate Fantastic Four . As part of the company\\'s Ultimate Marvel imprint, the series re-imagined the team as teenagers. [104] It ran for 60 issues (Feb. 2004 – Feb. 2009). In 2008, they also launched Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four , an out-of-continuity series aimed at younger readers. Although it was launched by Marvel as a continuation of the Fantastic Four title in 2011, FF continued publication as a separate series after the regular series resumed in 2012. From issues #12, the title focused on the youthful members of the Future Foundation, including Franklin and Valeria Richards. A second volume was launched as part of Marvel NOW! by Matt Fraction and Mike Allred depicting a substitute Fantastic Four team starring Scott Lang , Medusa , She-Hulk and Ms. Thing.  Solo series [ edit ]  The Human Torch solo [ edit ]  The Human Torch was given a solo strip in Strange Tales in 1962 to bolster the title\\'s sales. [3] : 98 The series began in Strange Tales #101 (October 1962), in 12- to 14-page stories plotted by Lee and initially scripted by his brother Larry Lieber , and drawn by penciller Kirby and inker Dick Ayers . Here, Johnny was seen living with his older sister, Susan, in fictional Glenview, Long Island , New York, where he continued high school and, with youthful naiveté, attempted to maintain a \"secret identity\". In Strange Tales #106 (March 1963), Johnny discovered that his friends and neighbors knew of his dual identity all along from Fantastic Four news reports, but were humoring him. Supporting characters included Johnny\\'s girlfriend, Doris Evans, usually in consternation as Johnny cheerfully flew off to battle bad guys. She was seen again in a 1973 issue of Fantastic Four , having become a heavyset but cheerful wife and mother. [105] Ayers took over the penciling after ten issues, later followed by original Golden Age Human Torch creator Carl Burgos and others. The Fantastic Four made occasional cameo appearances, and the Thing became a co-star with issue #123 (Aug. 1964). The Human Torch shared the split book Strange Tales with fellow feature Doctor Strange for the majority of its run, before being replaced in issue #135 (August 1965) by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. . The Silver Age stories were republished in 1974, along with some Golden Age Human Torch stories, in a short-lived ongoing Human Torch series. A later ongoing solo series in Marvel\\'s manga -influenced Tsunami imprint , Human Torch , ran 12 issues (June 2003 – June 2004), by writer Karl Kesel and penciler  Skottie Young . [106] The series was followed by the five-issue limited series Spider-Man/Human Torch (March–July 2005), an untold tales team-up arc spanning the course of their friendship.  The Thing solo [ edit ]  The Thing appeared in two team-up issues of Marvel Feature (#11–12, September–November 1973). Following their success, he was given his own regular team-up title Marvel Two-in-One , co-starring with Marvel heroes not only in the present day but occasionally in other time periods (fighting alongside the World War II -era Liberty Legion in #20 and the 1930s hero Doc Savage in #21, for example) and in alternate realities . The series ran 100 issues (January 1974 – June 1983), with seven summer annuals (1976–1982) and was immediately followed by the solo title The Thing #1–36 (July 1983 – June 1986). Another ongoing solo series, also titled The Thing , ran eight issues (January–August 2006).  Invisible Woman solo [ edit ]  In April 2019, Marvel Comics announced that it would publish Invisible Woman , a five-issue miniseries written by Mark Waid . This was Sue Storm\\'s first solo title. Adam Hughes drew the cover for Issue #1. [107]   Characters [ edit ]  The Fantastic Four is formed after four civilian astronauts are exposed to cosmic rays during an unauthorized outer space test flight in an experimental rocket ship designed by Dr. Reed Richards. Pilot Ben Grimm and crew-members Susan Storm and her brother Johnny Storm survive an emergency crash-landing in a field on Earth. Upon exiting the rocket, the four discover they have developed incredible superpowers , and decide to use these powers to help others. In the first issue the crew talks about Reed Richards\\' rocketship flying to the stars. Stan Lee\\'s original synopsis described the crew\\'s plan to fly to Mars, but Lee later shortly afterward wrote that due to \"the rate the Communists are progressing in space, maybe we better make this a flight to the STARS, instead of just to Mars, because by the time this mag goes on sale, the Russians may have already MADE a flight to Mars!\" [108]  In a significant departure from preceding superhero conventions, the Fantastic Four make no effort to maintain secret identities or, until issue #3, to wear superhero costumes, instead maintaining a public profile and enjoying celebrity status for scientific and heroic contributions to society. At the same time, they are often prone to arguing and even fighting with one another. Despite their bickering, the Fantastic Four consistently prove themselves to be \"a cohesive and formidable team in times of crisis.\" [51] : 204–205  While there have been a number of lineup changes to the group, the four characters who debuted in Fantastic Four #1 remain the core and most frequent lineup.  Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), a scientific genius, can stretch, twist and re-shape his body to inhuman proportions. Mr. Fantastic serves as the father figure of the group, and is \"appropriately pragmatic, authoritative, and dull\". [51] : 19 Richards blames himself for the failed space mission, particularly because of how the event transformed pilot Ben Grimm. [51] : 205 Stan Lee said the stretch powers were inspired by DC\\'s Plastic Man , which had no equivalent in Marvel. [109]  Invisible Girl/Invisible Woman (Susan Storm), Reed Richards\\' girlfriend (and eventual wife) has the ability to bend and manipulate light to render herself and others invisible. Stan Lee did not want Sue to have superstrength, \"to be Wonder Woman and punch people\", so eventually he came to invisibility, inspired by works such as The Invisible Man . [109] She later develops the ability to generate invisible force fields, which she uses for a variety of defensive and offensive effects.  The Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue Storm\\'s younger brother, possesses the ability to control fire, allowing him to project fire from his body, as well as the power to fly. This character was loosely based on a Human Torch character published by Marvel\\'s predecessor Timely Comics in the 1940s, an android that could ignite itself. Lee said that when he conceptualized the character, \"I thought it was a shame that we didn\\'t have The Human Torch anymore, and this was a good chance to bring him back\". [3] : 85 Unlike the teen sidekicks that preceded him, the Human Torch in the early stories was \"a typical adolescent — brash, rebellious, and affectionately obnoxious.\" [51] : 204 Johnny Storm was killed in the 2011 storyline \"Three\", [75] before being brought back and rejoining the reformed Fantastic Four. [81]  The Thing (Ben Grimm), Reed Richards\\' college roommate and best friend, has been transformed into a monstrous, orange, rock-like humanoid possessing high levels of superhuman strength and durability. The Thing is often filled with anger, self-loathing and self-pity over his new existence. He serves as \"an uncle figure, a long-term friend of the family with a gruff Brooklyn manner, short temper, and caustic sense of humor\". [51] : 204 In the original synopsis Lee gave to Kirby, The Thing was intended as \"the heavy\", but over the years, the character has become \"the most lovable group member: honest, direct and free of pretension\". [3] : 86 Lee said his original pitch to Kirby stated that The Thing was \"someone who turned into a monster\" and is bitter because unlike the other three he cannot change back to a normal appearance. [109]  The Fantastic Four has had several headquarters, most notably the Baxter Building , located at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue [110] in New York City. The Baxter Building was replaced by Four Freedoms Plaza at the same location after its destruction at the hands of Kristoff Vernard , adopted son of the team\\'s seminal foe Doctor Doom . (Prior to the completion of Four Freedoms Plaza, the team took up temporary residence at Avengers Mansion .) [111] Pier 4, a waterfront warehouse, served as a temporary headquarters after Four Freedoms Plaza was destroyed by the ostensible superhero team the Thunderbolts [112] shortly after the revelation that they were actually the supervillain team the Masters of Evil in disguise. Pier 4 was eventually destroyed during a battle with the longtime Fantastic Four supervillain Diablo , [113] [114] after which the team received a new Baxter Building, courtesy of one of team leader Reed Richards\\' former professors, Noah Baxter. This second Baxter Building was constructed in Earth\\'s orbit and teleported into the vacant lot formerly occupied by the original. [115]   Supporting characters [ edit ]  Allies and supporting characters [ edit ]  A number of characters are closely affiliated with the team, share complex personal histories with one or more of its members but have never actually held an official membership. Some of these characters include, but are not limited to: Namor the Sub-Mariner (previously an antagonist), Alicia Masters , [116]  Lyja the Lazerfist, H.E.R.B.I.E. , Kristoff Vernard ( Doctor Doom \\'s former protégé), Wyatt Wingfoot , [117] Sue and Johnny\\'s father Franklin Storm , the receptionist android Roberta , governess Agatha Harkness , [118] and Reed and Sue\\'s children Franklin Richards [34] and Valeria Richards . Several allies of the Fantastic Four have served as temporary members of the team, including Crystal , Medusa , [119]  Power Man (Luke Cage), Nova (Frankie Raye), [120]  She-Hulk , Ms. Marvel (Sharon Ventura), Ant-Man (Scott Lang) , Namorita , Storm , and the Black Panther . A temporary lineup from Fantastic Four #347–349 (December 1990 – February 1991) consisted of the Hulk (in his \"Joe Fixit\" persona), Spider-Man , Wolverine , and Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch) . [56]  Other notable characters who have been involved with the Fantastic Four include Alyssa Moy , Caledonia ( Alysande Stuart of Earth-9809), Fantastic Force , the Inhumans [20] (particularly the royal family members Black Bolt , Crystal, Medusa, Gorgon , Karnak , Triton , and Lockjaw ), Reed\\'s father Nathaniel Richards , the Silver Surfer (previously an antagonist), Thundra , postal worker Willie Lumpkin , Baxter Building landlord Walter Collins , the Thing\\'s rivals the Yancy Street Gang and Uatu the Watcher . Author Christopher Knowles states that Kirby\\'s work on creations such as the Inhumans and the Black Panther served as \"a showcase of some of the most radical concepts in the history of the medium\". [121]   Antagonists [ edit ]  Main article: List of Fantastic Four enemies  Writers and artists over many years have created a variety of characters to challenge the Fantastic Four. Knowles states that Kirby helped to create \"an army of villains whose rage and destructive power had never been seen before,\" and \"whose primary impulse is to smash the world.\" [121] Some of the team\\'s oldest and most frequent enmities have involved such foes as the Mole Man , the Skrulls , [23]  Namor the Sub-Mariner , Doctor Doom , the Puppet Master , Kang the Conqueror/Rama-Tut / Immortus , Blastaar , the Frightful Four , [122]  Annihilus , [35]  Galactus , and Klaw . Other prominent antagonists of the Fantastic Four have included the Wizard , the Impossible Man , [123] the Red Ghost and the Super-Apes , [124] the Mad Thinker , the Super-Skrull , the Molecule Man , [125]  Diablo , Dragon Man , [126]  Psycho-Man , Ronan the Accuser , Salem\\'s Seven , Terrax the Tamer , Terminus , Hyperstorm and Lucia von Bardas .  Fantastic Four Incorporated [ edit ]  Fantastic Four Incorporated , also known as Fantastic Enterprises , [127] is a fictional organization appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . It was founded by Reed Richards to license use of Richard\\'s patents and funded the Fantastic Four\\'s operation and their source of income. Staff are:  Susan Richards (Invisible Woman) [128] - CEO of Fantastic Four Inc.  Johnny Storm (Human Torch) [128] - made COO by Susan to give him some work ethic.  Christi Stoger [129] - with Ethan Crane, tried to frame Johnny Storm for a screw-up to get themselves promoted  Ethan Crane [129] - with Christi Stoger, tried to frame Johnny Storm for a screw-up to get themselves promoted  Jian Feeta [128] - Johnny\\'s Personal Assistant  Bethany Palmer [127] -  assisted out of abusive relationship with ex-husband, Jeff, by the Invisible Woman  Jed Schultz [130] - informed Reed about the embezzlement of their funds  Margaret Kofpulski [131]  Cultural impact [ edit ]  The Fantastic Four\\'s characterization was initially different from all other superheroes at the time. One major difference is that they do not conceal their identities , leading the public to be both suspicious and in awe of them. Also, they frequently argued and disagreed with each other, hindering their work as a team. [51] Described as \"heroes with hangups\" by Stan Lee, [132] the Thing has a temper, and the Human Torch resents being a child among adults. Mr. Fantastic blames himself for the Thing\\'s transformation. Social scientist Bradford W. Wright describes the team as a \"volatile mix of human emotions and personalities\". In spite of their disagreements, they ultimately function well as a team. [133]  The first issue of The Fantastic Four proved a success, igniting a new direction for superhero comics and soon influencing many other superhero comics. [134] Readers grew fond of Ben\\'s grumpiness, Johnny\\'s tendency to annoy others and Reed and Sue\\'s spats. Stan Lee was surprised at the reaction to the first issue, leading him to stay in the comics field despite previous plans to leave. Comics historian Stephen Krensky said that \"Lee\\'s natural dialogue and flawed characters appealed to 1960s kids looking to \\'get real\\'\". [15]  As of 2005, 150 million comics featuring the Fantastic Four had been sold. [132]   In other media [ edit ]  There have been four The Fantastic Four  animated TV series and three released feature films. The Fantastic Four also guest-starred in the \"Secret Wars\" story arc of the 1990s Spider-Man animated series , and the Thing guest-starred (with a small cameo from the other Fantastic Four members) in the \"Fantastic Fortitude\" episode of the 1996 The Incredible Hulk series . The Fantastic Four also appeared in the 2010 series The Avengers: Earth\\'s Mightiest Heroes . There was a short-lived radio show in 1975 that adapted early Lee/Kirby stories [135] and is notable for casting a pre- Saturday Night Live  Bill Murray as the Human Torch. Also in the cast were Bob Maxwell as Reed Richards , Cynthia Adler as Sue Storm , Jim Pappas as Ben Grimm and Jerry Terheyden as Doctor Doom . Other Marvel characters featured in the series included Ant-Man , Prince Namor , Nick Fury and the Hulk . Stan Lee narrated the series and the scripts were taken almost verbatim from the comic books. The radio show was packaged into five-minute segments, with five segments comprising a complete adventure. [136] The team appeared on the Power Records album Fantastic Four: \"The Way It Began\" book and record set, an audio dramatization of Fantastic Four #126. [137]   Television [ edit ]  The Fantastic Four has been the subject of four animated television series. The first, Fantastic Four , produced by Hanna-Barbera , [138] ran 20 episodes on ABC from September 9, 1967 to September 21, 1968. The second Fantastic Four series, produced by DePatie-Freleng , ran 13 episodes from September 9, 1978, to December 16, 1978; this series features a H.E.R.B.I.E. Unit in place of the Human Torch. [136]  In 1979, the Thing was featured as half of the Saturday morning cartoon Fred and Barney Meet the Thing . The character of the Thing received a radical make-over for the series. The title character for this program was Benjy Grimm, a teenage boy who possessed a pair of magic Thing-rings which could transform him into the Thing when he put them together and said \"Thing-ring, do your thing!\" The other members of the Fantastic Four do not appear in the series, nor do the animated The Flintstones stars Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble , despite the title of the program. [136] The third Fantastic Four was broadcast as part of The Marvel Action Hour umbrella, with introductions by Stan Lee. This series ran 26 episodes from September 24, 1994 to February 24, 1996. The fourth series, Fantastic Four: World\\'s Greatest Heroes , debuted on September 2, 2006, on Cartoon Network and ran for 26 episodes. Different Fantastic Four members appear briefly and with little or no dialogue and are mentioned various times throughout the first season of The Avengers: Earth\\'s Mightiest Heroes . The most expansive appearances are in the episode \"The Private War of Doctor Doom\", in which the Avengers team up with the Fantastic Four to battle the titular supervillain, and in the final episode of season two, in which the groups team up to battle Galactus . The Thing becomes a member of the New Avengers in episode 23 of season 2. The Fantastic Four appear in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode \"Monster No More.\" [139] The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. assist the Fantastic Four in thwarting the Tribbitite Invasion.  Film [ edit ]  Main article: Fantastic Four in film  A film adaptation of the characters, The Fantastic Four , was completed in 1994 by producer Roger Corman and starred Alex Hyde-White as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Rebecca Staab as Sue Storm-Richards/Invisible Woman, Jay Underwood as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, Michael Bailey Smith as Ben Grimm and Carl Ciarfalio as The Thing and Joseph Culp as Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom. The film was not released to theaters or on home video, but it has since been made available through bootleg video distributors. It was made because Constantin Film owned the film rights and would have lost them if it failed to begin production by a certain deadline, a tactic known as creating an ashcan copy . [140] According to producer Bernd Eichinger , Avi Arad had Marvel purchase the film for a few million dollars. [141]  In 2005, the second film adaptation, Fantastic Four directed by Tim Story , was released by 20th Century Fox . Despite mixed reviews from critics, it earned US$155 million in North America and $330 million worldwide. [142] [143] The sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer , directed by Story and written by Don Payne , was released in 2007. Despite mixed-to-negative reviews, the sequel earned $132 million in North America and a total of $330.6 million worldwide. [144] Both films feature Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic, Jessica Alba as Susan Storm / Invisible Woman, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm / Human Torch, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm / The Thing, and Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom / Dr. Doom. Stan Lee makes cameo appearances as the mailman Willie Lumpkin in the first film and as himself in the second film. A reboot directed by Josh Trank (also titled Fantastic Four , but stylized as Fant4stic ) was released on August 7, 2015. [145] The film stars Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm and Toby Kebbell as Doctor Doom . [146] [147] [148] It is based on Ultimate Fantastic Four . [149] It earned poor reviews and box office results. [150] On March 20, 2019, due to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney , the film rights of Fantastic Four reverted to Marvel Studios . [151]  In July 2019 at the San Diego Comic-Con , producer and head of Marvel Studios Kevin Feige , announced that a Fantastic Four film set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in development. [152] In December 2020, it was announced Jon Watts will direct the film.

Kirby was involved in an acrimonious dispute with Marvel Comics regarding the return of his artwork, and his relationship with Lee had deteriorated, in part due to this dispute but also due to Lee\\'s public statements through the years, which Kirby saw as diminishing his role. Groth states: \"Lee\\'s contribution is a matter for endless speculation, but most observers and historians consider Kirby\\'s claims here to be excessive.\"    References [ edit ]    ^ a  b  c  Lee, Stan (September 1974).

Fictional character appearing in Marvel Comics publications and related media    Norman Osborn Artwork for the cover of Dark Reign: The Goblin Legacy #1 (July 2009 Marvel Comics). Art by Kalman Andrasofszky Publication information Publisher Marvel Comics First appearance as Green Goblin: The Amazing Spider-Man #14 (July 1964) as Norman Osborn: The Amazing Spider-Man #37 (June 1966) as Iron Patriot: Dark Avengers #1 (March 2009) as Mason Banks: Superior Spider-Man #17 (November 2013) as Red Goblin:  The Amazing Spider-Man #798 (April 2018) Created by Stan Lee Steve Ditko In-story information Full name Norman Virgil Osborn Species Human mutate Team affiliations Oscorp Sinister Twelve Daily Bugle Commission on Superhuman Activities Thunderbolts H.A.M.M.E.R. Dark Avengers Dark X-Men Cabal Goblin Nation Power Elite Notable aliases Green Goblin , Iron Patriot , Overload, Super-Adaptoid , Mason Banks, Goblin King , Hobgoblin , Red Goblin Abilities  Superhuman strength, stamina, durability, agility and reflexes due to ingesting the Goblin Formula  Regeneration  Genius-level intellect  Proficient scientist  Master hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist  Utilizing goblin-themed weapons and a Goblin Glider   Norman Osborn is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko , and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #14 ( cover dated  July 1964 ) as the original and most well-known incarnation of Green Goblin . As the amoral industrialist head of Oscorp , Norman was exposed to an experimental formula which enhanced his physical abilities and intellect, but also drove him to insanity. Having endured as Spider-Man \\'s archenemy , Osborn has been part of the superhero\\'s defining  stories as well as being the father of Harry Osborn and Gabriel Stacy , the grandfather of Normie Osborn , and the killer of Gwen Stacy , Ben Reilly and Flash Thompson . Although his primary obsession is Spider-Man, Osborn has often come into conflict with Iron Man , Captain America and other superheroes in the Marvel Universe . As the Goblin, he adopted a Halloween -themed appearance: dressing in a goblin costume, riding on a bat-shaped \"Goblin Glider\", and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, such as grenade-like \"Pumpkin Bombs\", to terrorize New York City . Although Osborn sometimes works with other supervillains such as Doctor Doom and Loki and groups like the Sinister Six and the Dark Avengers , these relationships often collapse due to his desire for unbridled chaos and destruction. In recent years, Osborn gained new status as a public hero as the original iteration of Iron Patriot . The character has been in various top villain lists as one of Spider-Man\\'s greatest enemies and one of the greatest comic book villains of all time. The character\\'s popularity has seen him appear on a variety of merchandise, inspire real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and be referenced in a number of media. He has been adapted to serve as Spider-Man\\'s adversary in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. Willem Dafoe portrayed the character in Sam Raimi\\'s Spider-Man film trilogy and Chris Cooper portrayed the character in the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2 . Among others, Neil Ross , Alan Rachins , Steve Blum , Steven Weber and Josh Keaton provided the character\\'s voice throughout various animated Spider-Man series over the years.

Cover art by Steve Ditko .  Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko are credited with creating the character, they each collaborated with one another on how the character would be portrayed. [1] According to Ditko: \"Stan\\'s synopsis for the Green Goblin had a movie crew, on location, finding an Egyptian -like sarcophagus . Inside was an ancient, mythological  demon , the Green Goblin . He naturally came to life. On my own, I changed Stan\\'s mythological demon into a human villain\". [2]  The Green Goblin debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #14. [3] At this time his identity was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which made a point of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr. , who replaced Ditko as the title\\'s artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn\\'t yet been introduced. [4] [5] [6] Lee elaborated: \"Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it\\'s somebody you didn\\'t know and had never seen, then what was the point of following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader\". [6] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, [6] and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko\\'s. [7] Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished. Though Osborn would not be introduced by name until The Amazing Spider-Man #37, Ditko has said that a character he drew in the background of two panels in issue #23 was intended to be Osborn, seeded in advance of the reveal. This background character, a member of a businessmen\\'s club and a friend of J. Jonah Jameson, would reappear in The Amazing Spider-Man #25, 26, and 27, and when Norman was formally introduced in issue #37, he too was stated to be a member of the club and friend of Jameson\\'s. [2] [8]  Ditko left the series with issue #38, just one issue after Norman Osborn was introduced as the father of Harry Osborn . [9] The first issue without Ditko saw the Green Goblin unmasked. John Romita, Sr. , who replaced Ditko as the title\\'s artist, recalled:  .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} Stan wouldn\\'t have been able to stand it if Ditko did the story and didn\\'t reveal that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn. I didn\\'t know there was any doubt about Osborn being the Goblin. I didn\\'t know that Ditko had just been setting Osborn up as a straw dog. I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it. I had been following the last couple of issues and didn\\'t think there was really much mystery about it. Looking back, I doubt the Goblin\\'s identity would have been revealed in Amazing #39 if Ditko had stayed on. [10]  In the landmark story \" The Night Gwen Stacy Died\" ( The Amazing Spider-Man #121-122) , the Green Goblin kills Gwen Stacy and later perishes in a fight against Spider-Man . However, the story\\'s writer, Gerry Conway , had Harry Osborn adopt the Green Goblin identity in the aftermath of \" The Night Gwen Stacy Died \", later remarking that \"I never had any intention of getting rid of the Green Goblin as a concept\". [11] Harry Osborn\\'s becoming the Green Goblin was mostly well-received, with fans remarking that Harry was more menacing than his father had ever been. [12] Writer Roger Stern later introduced the Hobgoblin to replace the Green Goblin as Spider-Man\\'s archenemy . [13]   Return [ edit ]  During the \" Clone Saga \", a retcon was made, which determined that Norman Osborn survived the events of The Amazing Spider-Man #122, and had been playing a behind-the-scenes role in Spider-Man\\'s adventures since then. [14] [15] During the \"Clone Saga\", the Spider-Man writers were met with a massive outcry from many readers after the decision to replace Peter Parker with his clone Ben Reilly as the true Spider-Man. Eventually, the writers decided to reveal that one of Spider-Man\\'s arch-enemies had been manipulating events from behind the scenes. The initial plan was to use Mephisto , but they felt a more down-to-earth character was needed. [16] It was then suggested that the semi- zombified cyborg \" Gaunt \" be revealed as Harry Osborn (who was killed in The Spectacular Spider-Man #200). Gaunt was a late entry to the controversial storyline, created mainly as a plot device to return Harry to life; the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter into thinking he was a clone, and assuming his father\\'s Green Goblin identity. However, this narrative was rejected by newly-promoted editor in chief  Bob Harras , [17] and eventually Norman was chosen to be the mastermind. Following the Clone Saga, Green Goblin re-established himself as a supervillain and Spider-Man\\'s nemesis, serving as the main antagonist of several arcs thereafter. [18]  Osborn returns in Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75 and is blown up at the end of the issue. [19] It is shown in Spectacular Spider-Man #250 that he has recovered, and he returns to his civilian life. Without the Green Goblin identity, Osborn would then go on to attack Spider-Man indirectly, through minions and via smear campaigns designed to portray him as a monster. However, Norman would still wear his Green Goblin costume when needed to. [20]   New roles [ edit ]  When Spider-Man revealed his public identity, Osborn is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in Paris. [21] Following the Civil War story arc, Warren Ellis began writing Thunderbolts , [22] and Osborn was brought into this title as the director of the eponymous team. He was one of several characters offered to Ellis, who picked him because, according to Thunderbolts editor Molly Lazer, \"[t]here was something about Norman, his instability, and his fixation with Spider-Man that Warren liked, so he\\'s in the book!\" [23] Ellis admitted not being very familiar with the character, saying: \"All I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating and his eyes were always bulging out of his head. That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld -like public governmental figure... [ Joe Quesada ] talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing\". [24] Lazer confirmed that the new team was answerable to the Commission on Superhuman Activities , giving him the opportunity to do what he wanted: \"He\\'s a free man with a lot of power .... And his agenda, well, it\\'s not that secret. He wants to get Spider-Man\". [25]  Writer Christos Gage took over for the Secret Invasion tie-in stories, [26] [27] which end with Osborn taking credit for the defeat of the Skrulls after he kills the Skrull queen Veranke . [28] This allowed the character to be placed into an influential position in the aftermath of Dark Reign . Although the dark turn at the end was always part of the plan for the storyline, Brian Michael Bendis , Secret Invasion \\'s writer, says that Osborn was picked for the leading role because of the changes implemented by Ellis. [29] [30]  Meanwhile, Andy Diggle took over the writing of Thunderbolts . [31] He introduced new characters to serve as Osborn\\'s black ops team, explaining:  To quote the movie Speed , he\\'s \\'crazy, not stupid\\'. He\\'s clearly fiercely intelligent and a natural born leader, with the ego and competitive drive to succeed against all odds. He also just happens to be crazy as a shithouse rat. [...] I think the secret to understanding Norman is that he doesn\\'t realize he\\'s the villain. He thinks he\\'s the hero. He truly believes that he deserves public adulation, and it bugs the hell out of him that so-called \\'superheroes\\' are getting it instead of him. [32] [33] [34]  He appeared as a regular character in the Dark Avengers series from issue #1 (March 2009) through issue #16 (June 2010), [35] as well as the mini-series \"Siege\", which saw Norman being arrested for his crimes, following the events of the Civil War storyline. [36]  The first was \"Brand New Ways To Die\" which featured Norman and the Thunderbolts versus Spider-Man and the original Venom. [37] His second appearance explained that following Mephisto \\'s alteration of Spider-Man\\'s past, Norman\\'s return was significantly altered. He had returned earlier than he had originally, and, due to concern for his son\\'s mental wellbeing after once again being the Green Goblin, had arranged for Harry\\'s death to be faked, with help from Mysterio . [38] In his final appearance in the storyline, Norman attempts to convince Harry to become a super-hero so that Norman can kill his son off and exploit said demise. It is also revealed that he was sleeping with the supervillain Menace (Harry\\'s ex-girlfriend), with Norman believing that the villain\\'s child she was carrying was his. [39]  A five issue mini-series followed, written by writer Kelly Sue DeConnick and artist Emma Rios . The mini-series would lead into a dual storyline running in the pages of New Avengers #17–24 and Avengers #18–24, in which the character formed a new version of the Dark Avengers and ultimately garnered new powers, having turned himself into a Super-Adaptoid . [40]   Fictional character biography [ edit ]  Early life [ edit ]  Norman was born in New Haven, Connecticut as the son of wealthy industrialist Amberson Osborn. Amberson, a brilliant student in the fields of science, became an alcoholic after losing control of a manufacturing company and fortune, and became physically abusive toward the family. Norman quickly came to despise his father, resolving to be a better breadwinner while developing early homicidal tendencies as a means of relieving the stress of his father\\'s abuse. [41]  In college, where he studied chemistry , business administration , and electrical engineering , Norman meets his college sweetheart , eventually getting married and have their son Harold \"Harry\" Osborn . In his adulthood, with the help of his college professor Mendel Stromm , he co-founds the chemical company Oscorp Industries and establishes himself as CEO and President. The company was hugely successful, and Norman re-gained the wealth that he had lost during his childhood. However, his wife becomes ill and dies when Harry is barely a year old, [42] the stress of which pushes Norman to work harder, leading him to emotionally neglect Harry. Hoping to gain more control of Oscorp Industries, Osborn accused Stromm of embezzlement and has his partner arrested and shares in his company sold to him. Searching his former mentor\\'s possessions, Norman discovers an experimental strength/intelligence enhancement formula, but in attempting to create the serum, it turns green and explodes in his face. The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical abilities as intended, but also has the side-effect of driving him into self-destructive insanity, just like his father from years ago. [43]   The original Green Goblin [ edit ]   Norman Osborn as Green Goblin on the cover of Secret Invasion: Dark Reign vol. 1 #1 (December 2008). Art by Bryan Hitch .  Norman adopts the Green Goblin identity with the goal of being the leader of organized crime in New York City, and intends to cement his position by defeating Spider-Man . Acting on his own as the Goblin, or through his employment of other super-criminals such as the Headsman , [44] he would harass Spider-Man many times, but fail to achieve his goal. [45] Soon, Stromm returns from prison, and attempts to exact revenge on Osborn using an army of robots, but Norman is saved by Spider-Man, and Stromm apparently dies of a heart attack. [46]  In order to discover his nemesis\\'s secret identity, Osborn exposes Spider-Man to a gas that nullifies the hero\\'s spider-senses. This allows Osborn to stalk Spider-Man until he learns that his nemesis is Peter Parker , a college student and his son\\'s classmate and best friend. While Parker is going about civilian life, Osborn surprises and knocks Parker out with an asphyxiation grenade, taking the youth to his waterfront base. After unmasking himself to Parker, the latter goads him into recounting how he became the Goblin, and uses the time to break free. In the ensuing battle, Spider-Man accidentally knocks Osborn into a mass of electrical wires, wiping out his memory . Feeling sorry for his nemesis, and wishing to avoid the shame that would befall the Osborn family (especially Parker\\'s best friend Harry), Spider-Man destroys the Goblin costume in the resulting fire and tells the authorities that Osborn lost his memory while helping to defeat the Goblin. [47]  Soon, Osborn is troubled by repressed memories of the Goblin and Spider-Man. After a presentation on supervillains by NYPD Captain George Stacy restores Osborn\\'s memory, he experiences a brief return to his Goblin persona. While abducting Parker\\'s friends and threatening Parker\\'s elderly aunt , he is exposed to one of his own \"psychedelic bombs\", causing a relapse of amnesia . [48]  Later, Osborn stumbles upon an old Goblin hideout which, again, restores his memory. However, the shock of seeing Harry hospitalized, overdosed on drugs, causes Osborn\\'s amnesia to return once more. [49] After the final restoration of his memories, the Goblin kidnaps and takes Gwen Stacy to a bridge. [50] [51] During Spider-Man\\'s rescue attempt, Osborn knocks Gwen off the bridge , resulting in the girl\\'s death. Spider-Man, traumatised and obsessed with revenge, tracks the Goblin to his hideout, and in the ensuing battle, Osborn is impaled by his own goblin glider and dies. [52]   Return [ edit ]  While Osborn lies in the morgue, it is revealed that the Goblin formula gave him a previously-unknown healing factor which restores him to life; in the process of sneaking out, he kills someone with a similar physique to himself to feign his death. No longer suffering from bouts of amnesia, Norman escapes to Europe, where he can move freely and unnoticed ( later revealed he was in France for some time). During this time abroad, believed dead by the general public, he orchestrates several plots, including replacing May Parker with a genetically altered actress, [53] and faking his own son\\'s death (after Mephisto \\'s manipulations of the timeline); [54] prior to the timeline change, Harry\\'s corpse, at one point, was exhumed and tested. [55]  Most significantly, however, he utilizes his fortune to build a vast network of criminals, spies, dupes and co-conspirators to help engineer what would be an almost impossibly complex and meticulously planned plot to destroy Spider-Man\\'s life. To achieve this, he\\'s the leader of the Scrier cabal, taking as his pawns Seward Trainer, Judas Traveller , the Jackal and the cyborg Gaunt, all of whom he utilizes to carry out revenge against Parker. It is this group of individuals who are crucial in duping Parker into believing that the youth is actually a clone of himself created by Jackal, [56] while claiming that the clone – who comes to be known as Ben Reilly – is actually the original. [57] Frustrated by Parker\\'s perseverance despite everything that\\'s been inflicted, [58] Osborn publicly reveals that he\\'s alive on Halloween . During the battle that ensues between the two, Osborn attempts to kill Parker by impaling his nemesis with his goblin glider. When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker from Osborn (and immediately deteriorates upon death as all of the Jackal\\'s clones do), Parker discovers of actually being the original. During this same period, Osborn was also responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter & Mary Jane\\'s newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently caused the stillbirth of the baby. [19]  Returning to his former seat of power, Osborn regains control of his business and also buys out the Daily Bugle , humiliating former friend and societal peer J. Jonah Jameson as the latter no longer has control over the newspaper. He also torments Ben Urich and demands a retraction over an exposé of his time as the Goblin, providing faked evidence that he never was the supervillain, despite Urich\\'s extensive research. [59] However, he saves his most sadistic treatment for Peter, acting not only as a constant reminder of all the pain he\\'s inflicted on his nemesis over the years, but a looming threat that could strike at any time. This build-up of pressure eventually makes Spider-Man snap by savagely beating the civilian and non-resistant Osborn in front of the latter\\'s CCTV , which, combined with Osborn convincing the Trapster to frame Spider-Man for murder, results in Spider-Man being a fugitive again. [20] To get around this, Peter adopts four new identities , using two of these identities to convince Trapster to expose Osborn\\'s scheme, [60] and provide fake evidence that the individual that beat up Osborn was an impostor. [61]  For a time, Osborn retires his costumed persona and uses a stand-in so as not to be suspected of being the Green Goblin. [62] This fifth Goblin kidnaps Norman\\'s grandson and clashes with the wanted and injured Spider-Man. [63] Norman also crosses paths with Roderick Kingsley and initiates a hostile takeover of Kingsley\\'s corporate empire, in retaliation for raiding the Goblin\\'s arsenal and identity . [64] While his stand-in is masquerading as the Goblin, Osborn joins a cult, hoping to receive great power from the \\'Gathering of Five\\', which will grant the participants Power, Knowledge, Immortality, Madness or Death, but while he believes that he will receive Power, he is instead given Madness, which worsens his already mental instability, and threatens the world with genetic bombs. It is during this time that Peter learns May is alive and Osborn\\'s actress died in May\\'s place. Osborn\\'s complete madness is evident, as he hallucinates unmasking and killing Peter; yet in reality Peter easily defeats him. He is rescued from custody thereafter by his cabal of henchmen. [65]  A few months later, the highly unstable Osborn has partially regained his sanity with the help of anti-psychotic drugs. He comes to see Parker as the son he had always wanted and attempts to have Parker take on the Green Goblin mantle using physiological torture, but ultimately fails. [66] Osborn\\'s next plan involves using Flash Thompson drive drunk a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage. This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle. During this confrontation, the emotionally weary Parker tells Osborn of being tired of their constant battle, and declares a truce. [67]  Osborn\\'s Goblin identity is revealed to the public once again through an investigation by Jessica Jones , after Osborn murders one of the reporters from the Daily Bugle . After a battle with Spider-Man and Luke Cage , Osborn is arrested and sent to prison for the first time. [68] However, things were far from over. From behind bars, Osborn again masterminded a plan against Spider-Man. This time, he has MacDonald \"Mac\" Gargan as Scorpion kidnap May. The plan was for Spider-Man to break Osborn out of prison in exchange for Parker\\'s aunt\\'s life. Peter reluctantly agreed and with the help of the Black Cat proceeded to break Osborn out, only to have twelve of his greatest enemies waiting on the outside. Osborn had assembled a team of supervillains . However, Mary Jane Watson had contacted S.H.I.E.L.D. , and the villains were faced not only by Spider-Man, but the combined might of Captain America , Iron Man , Yellowjacket , Daredevil and the Fantastic Four . During the fracas, the Goblin manages to escape and kidnap Mary Jane, taking Peter\\'s love interest to the George Washington Bridge in order to replay the murder of the last love interest. However, Doctor Octopus intervenes, attacking the Goblin. Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane after a bolt of lightning sends the two villains into the river. Following some verbal clues from the Goblin, Peter also discovers where he had hidden May, and rescues the latter as well. It is revealed that Osborn sent Peter a letter before the fight, thanking Peter for giving his life meaning and purpose, but Peter never received the letter due to moving to a different residence. [69]  Years after Gwen\\'s death, it is revealed that Osborn had a one-night stand with Gwen after being overwhelmed by his charisma, which led to Gwen\\'s pregnancy with his illegitimate twin children . Osborn thus has three motives for killing Gwen; revenge against Spider-Man, to prevent Gwen from talking of their affair and creating a scandal, and to take their children to raise by himself, thus being his ideal heirs. Mary Jane was the only person who knew of their encounter and their children\\'s existence prior to Gwen\\'s death, despising Osborn for his immoral behaviors long before discovering he\\'s the villainous Goblin. Gabriel and Sarah (who rapidly aged to adulthood years because of the Goblin formula in their genes) return to attack Peter as Osborn has the twins believe that Peter is the twins\\' father who abandoned the two and responsible for Gwen\\'s death to which Peter learned the details of Gwen\\'s past with Osborn and the twins from Mary Jane. Peter is able to convince Sarah of Osborn\\'s villainy, the truth of Sarah\\'s paternity and circumstances of Gwen\\'s death, and stabilized the Goblin physiology with a blood transfusion due to Peter\\'s blood type matching Sarah\\'s. Meanwhile, Gabriel personally learns the truth of his relation to Osborn after watching a video message at one of the Goblin lairs, aligning with his father to stabilize his own condition using a variation of the Goblin formula at the cost of sanity. [70]   H.A.M.M.E.R. and the Dark Avengers [ edit ]   Norman Osborn as Iron Patriot on the cover of Dark Avengers vol. 1, #1 (December 2008). Art by Mike Deodato Jr.  Osborn attempts to distance himself from his Green Goblin persona after being prescribed medication for his mental state. During the \" Civil War \" over the Superhuman Registration Act , Osborn is appointed director of the Thunderbolts superhero team, now tasked to apprehend anyone who resists registering. [71] While in this capacity, he directs the Thunderbolts to apprehend or kill Spider-Man, [72] but after Mephisto  changes reality , Harry Osborn is alive once more, and no one (including Norman) knows Spider-Man\\'s secret identity. [73] In the end, Spider-Man manages to evade this coordinated attack and escape. [74]  During the \" Secret Invasion \" by shape-shifting extra-terrestrials, the Skrulls , Osborn shoots and kills the Skrull queen Veranke . [75] He leverages this widely publicized success, positioning himself as the new director of the S.H.I.E.L.D.-like paramilitary force H.A.M.M.E.R. to advance his agenda, [75] while using his public image to start his own Dark Avengers , substituting Moonstone for Ms. Marvel , Bullseye for Hawkeye , Gargan for Spider-Man, Daken for Wolverine and Noh-Varr for Captain Marvel , as well as manipulating Ares and the Sentry into helping to further his cause. Osborn himself leads the Dark Avengers as the Iron Patriot, a suit of armor fashioned by himself after Iron Man\\'s armor with Captain America\\'s colors. [76] Osborn simultaneously forms the Cabal alliance with Doctor Doom , Emma Frost , Namor , Loki and the Hood , [77] but this \\'alliance\\' quickly falls apart when Namor and Frost betray the Cabal to aid the X-Men . [78] Norman\\'s attempts to exert his authority are increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes. After the Superhuman Registration Act records are deleted so that Osborn has no access to the information recorded about heroes after it was implemented, Osborn attacked the brain-damaged Tony Stark, thus showing Osborn brutally assaulting a physically and mentally incapable individual that was not even attempting to strike back. [79] After the New Avengers are forced to allow Osborn to capture Cage when needing medical treatment, the team uses a tracking device Osborn had planted in Luke to trick him into blowing up his own house after rescuing Cage from Osborn\\'s custody. [80]  Harry is approached by Norman with the offer of a job within the Dark Avengers. [81] Norman welcomes Harry into Avengers Tower, wanting to make his son into the American Son . [82] When Harry finds a cure for Lily Hollister\\'s Goblin condition for their baby\\'s safety, Lily reveals that it is a ruse to coerce Harry into taking the American Son armor, whom Norman had plotted would die in a tragedy to increase sympathy for Norman and his Dark Avengers. When Lily also reveals that the baby is not Harry\\'s but in fact Norman\\'s, Harry dons his American Son armor, and fights Norman in his Iron Patriot armor. [83] During the battle, Norman declares that Harry is no longer his son, and that he has bred a better child to replace the \\'failure\\' of Harry. After further taunts from Norman, Harry lashes out and defeats his father, declaring \"I was never your son!\". When Harry has the option of killing Norman, Spider-Man says to decapitate him, since Norman\\'s healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man also cautions Harry that killing Norman will cause Harry to \"become the son Norman always wanted\". Harry instead backs down, and turns away from his father forever. [84]  At Loki\\'s suggestion, Osborn creates a rationale to invade Asgard , claiming the world (which was, at the time, positioned at the outskirts of Broxton, Oklahoma ) poses a national security threat, by sending the U-Foes to attack Volstagg in Chicago, leading to the destruction of Soldier Field . During a pitched battle with several superheroes, Sentry causes Thor \\'s world to fall to Earth. Osborn fights with the recently-resurrected Steve Rogers, however, Stark removes Osborn\\'s Iron Patriot armor remotely, revealing Osborn used green facepaint to create a goblin-like look. Osborn screams that the Avengers do not know what they have done, only for Spider-Man to knock him down. He tells them they are all dead as the Void is released. [85] Osborn knocks out Rogers and tries to escape, but is captured by Volstagg. Incarcerated in the Raft penitentiary, he blames his Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world. [86]  When transferred to a secret underwater government base, Osborn takes steps to ensure his release from prison. He uses a group of followers known as the \"Green Goblin Cult\" to break out with the aid of corrupt senators; he plans to turn himself in after killing his fellow escapees, setting him up as a \\'champion\\' of the judicial system. [87] After the breakout, he awaits his trial in a new prison, this one controlled by his cult members. [88] Using his staged persona as a voice for the \\'disenfranchised\\', Osborn plans to regain the Iron Patriot armor and creates a new team of Dark Avengers, this time substituting June Covington for Scarlet Witch , Ai Apaec for Spider-Man, Barney Barton for Hawkeye, Skaar for Hulk , Superia for Ms. Marvel, Gorgon for Wolverine and the A.I.M.-rebuilt Ragnarok for Thor. [89] In the team\\'s first fight with the New Avengers , Osborn reveals himself as the Super-Adaptoid , declares himself the head of world security, and orders that the Avengers be arrested for war crimes. However, double agent Skaar betrays Osborn, allowing the Avengers to dogpile Osborn\\'s body, overloading him with superpowers and sending him into a coma. A.I.M. and HYDRA pick up Osborn\\'s leftover resources, and H.A.M.M.E.R. is disbanded. [90] After the Hobgoblin returns to New York, a nurse and doctor are called to Norman\\'s hospital room, only to find him gone. [91]   The Goblin King [ edit ]  When the children that work for the Vulture are discussing what to do after Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius\\'s mind in Spider-Man\\'s body) brutally defeats the Vulture, the Green Goblin approaches and tells the group that he will be the one that crushes Superior Spider-Man. [92] The Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains\\' gangs like Vulture, Owl , and the third White Dragon \\'s gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals). As he builds this army to attack Superior Spider-Man, he takes on the new alias of the Goblin King . [93] The Hand ninjas who evaded capture arrive at the sewers and join up with the Goblin Nation. The group reveals in the news that, thanks to Superior Spider-Man\\'s assault, Osborn now owns over half of New York\\'s organized crime. He claims he now owns New York City as the Goblin Kingpin of Crime. [94] With Menace \\'s help, Osborn later releases Phil Urich from a prison transport and upgrades Urich\\'s Goblin armor and weapons, asking in return only that Urich\\'s only identity from here on shall be Goblin Knight. [95] Osborn trains Goblin Knight, anxious to confront Superior Spider-Man. [96] Osborn later poses as the Hobgoblin and is sighted by some of the Spiderlings. [97]  Upon Carlie Cooper being brought to his lair by Menace, he receives Carlie\\'s journal from Menace which reveals to him that Otto\\'s mind is in Spider-Man\\'s body. [98] Osborn douses Carlie with the Goblin formula, causing the woman to mutate into the new superhuman villain Monster. He demands to know Spider-Man\\'s identity, but Monster first asks the Goblin to reveal his own identity. He assures Monster that he is Norman, but refuses to remove his Goblin mask until Carlie has proven a loyal follower and dispatches Monster and Menace on a mission. [99] Osborn battles and kills Hobgoblin, although it is revealed to be a servant with Kingsley still in hiding abroad which Goblin Knight discovers. [100]  Having staged a coup of New York after spreading his resources by exploiting Otto\\'s reliance on technology, Osborn directly confronts Superior Spider-Man, angry that he was cheated out of the opportunity to defeat his enemy, but offering Otto the chance to join him and Otto rejects the offer. When Otto finds being unable to win against Osborn\\'s resources, having had various allies abandoned, and with faith in his own abilities gone, Otto sacrifices himself to restore the original Spider-Man\\'s mind in order to save Anna Maria Marconi . [101] When Spider-Man arrives for the final confrontation, Osborn quickly realizes that the original personality is back in control when Spider-Man responds to his nemesis\\' taunts with his own wisecracks . [102] In the duel that follows, Spider-Man unmasks Osborn, learning that he has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, acting as Alchemax\\'s CEO and intending to re-establish himself as businessman Mason Banks, now that his true likeness is too publicly known as a supervillain. Spider-Man defeats and strips the villain\\'s powers with Otto\\'s serum, but Norman manages to escape through Liz Allan \\'s discreet aid. In hiding once again, he reflects that the various heroes will be unprepared for him when he returns with a new identity and approach as a businessman, seemingly no longer afflicted by the mental illness associated with the Goblin formula. [103]   All New, All Different Marvel [ edit ]  Osborn\\'s Goblin King position was quickly usurped by Phil Urich. [104] However, a mysterious man with a bandaged face is soon shown to be selling Goblin-based weaponry globally to attack Parker Industries . This man reveals himself to be Norman alive again post- Secret Wars and still planning on getting revenge on Spider-Man. [105] He is revealed to have played a part in the recent coup of Symkaria . [106] He restores a semblance of his original features via a twisted form of plastic surgery but which also resembles the Green Goblin\\'s facets, and intends to release a modified version of the Goblin formula to turn the whole country into Goblin-powered soldiers programmed to be loyal to him. [107]  However, in his final confrontation with Spider-Man, despite exposing his foe to a series of gases to temporarily neutralize all of his powers, and triggering an EMP to shut down all the gadgetry within his new Spider-armor, Spider-Man is still able to defeat Osborn as the two clash. Managing to escape while Peter is distracted, Osborn resolves to find a means of restoring his powers, concluding that he has only ever defeated Spider-Man when allowing himself to draw on his inner demons. [108]    Norman Osborn as Red Goblin on the cover of The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 1 #799 (June 2018). Art by Alex Ross .  The apparent first step in this plan occurs during the \" Go Down Swinging \" storyline when Osborn manages to steal the Carnage symbiote from an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse while Spider-Man is occupied with the return of Zodiac. [109] Osborn\\'s efforts to control the Carnage symbiote initially backfire when he merges with it and finds himself overwhelmed by the urge to kill rather than his own prior plan to direct its power against Spider-Man specifically, [110] but he is able to convince it to let him have control in favor of trying something other than its usual mindless slaughter. [111] While interrogating a captive Jameson for information on Spider-Man, Osborn takes a brief interval from the torture to kill the self-proclaimed Goblin King who tried to raid one of his old storehouses. After Osborn appeared as the Green Goblin, Jameson mentioned how he could not stop Spider-Man since even throwing Gwen off the bridge did not stop him from fighting back. Those words caused Norman to remember that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. [112] Attacking the Daily Bugle in his familiar Goblin attire, Osborn gives the rest of the staff time to evacuate as he fights Peter before revealing his new bond with Carnage, proclaiming himself to be the Red Goblin, driving Spider-Man away with \\'Carnage bombs\\' that injure his leg. Discovering a sound-transmitting spider-tracer planted on him, Osborn uses this to deliver a \\'devil\\'s bargain\\' to Peter; if Peter abandons the Spider-Man identity and never performs any further heroics, Osborn will leave Parker alone, but the second he sees any sign of Spider-Man\\'s return he will kill everyone in Peter\\'s life. Peter places the Spider-Man top on a flagpole so that Osborn can see it burn, but privately vows that he will find a way to defeat Osborn as Peter rather than Spider-Man. [113] Peter is able to contact various allies like Human Torch , Clash , Silk , Miles Morales , and Agent Anti-Venom to watch over his loved ones. When Norman moves against the Osborns and proves immune to Carnage\\'s traditional weaknesses of Human Torch\\'s fire and Clash\\'s sound devices, Peter is forced to step back into action despite the injured leg, with Agent Anti-Venom sacrificing a chance to get back into action himself to heal Spider-Man\\'s injury as Osborn merges a part of the Carnage symbiote with his grandson Normie turning into a miniature version of Red Goblin. [114]  Normie goes after May but she gets some unexpected help in the form of Superior Octopus and J. Jonah Jameson who uses an old Spider-Slayer , however both are defeated by Norman. Soon afterwards, Normie watches as his grandfather throws Liz through a window only to be rescued by Spider-Man which causes Normie to turn on Norman. Norman reveals to Spider-Man he infected some of Peter\\'s friends and family with slivers of the Carnage symbiote which he could send to their brain to kill them. However, it turns out that Flash has figured out Spider-Man\\'s secret identity too and went to May and Mary Jane in order to remove those ticking time bombs. Flash then takes the fight to Norman and while it appears as if he\\'s gaining the upper hand, it turns out that Norman still has some Green Goblin tech beneath the Carnage symbiote and he uses that to electrocute Flash. Flash\\'s injuries prove to be fatal and dies in Spider-Man\\'s arms. Spider-Man confronts Norman at Times Square as Red Goblin gains the upper hand. Peter manages to hold him off by pointing out that it\\'s not the Goblin killing the Spider, but rather Carnage and Cletus Kasady . The villain is enraged by this and when Peter removes the Venom symbiote and to challenge him, Norman takes off the Carnage symbiote to reveal his old Green Goblin persona. Spider-Man manages to take his foe down and when the villain begs the Carnage symbiote to help him, the wall-crawler seemingly destroys it by hitting it with an exploding gas tank. However, the Carnage symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, and he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe\\'s mind. Norman is last seen incarcerated at Ravencroft and believes that Spider-Man is Osborn and he is Kasady. [115]  When Kasady starts hunting all former symbiote hosts to extract the samples of the symbiote codex left in them with the goal of awakening a symbiote god as seen in the \" Absolute Carnage \" storyline, Spider-Man and Venom attempt to retrieve Osborn from Ravencroft to test a machine that can extract the codex from former hosts, as the Maker is uncertain of potential side-effects. However, Carnage attacks Ravencroft as they attempt to retrieve Osborn, transforming most of the patients into his drone soldiers and turning Osborn into another version of Carnage due to him still believing himself to be Kasady. [116] As Spider-Man works to keep Normie Osborn and Dylan Brock safe, a flashback showed that Kindred had visited Norman Osborn in Ravencroft. He quoted that Norman looked down on the citizens of New York from his tower and states that he could have his centipedes rip him apart if he wanted them to. Kindred even made a reference to how he appeared in Mary Jane\\'s nightmares and how he would not be able to kill Spider-Man as Kindred states that he \"already won a long time ago.\" Back in the present, Norman has defeated Spider-Man. [117] In the rest of the flashback, Kindred sent one of his centipedes into Osborn\\'s head in order to save him from himself. Back in the present, Osborn\\'s Carnage form feels a scratching in his head as he tells Kindred to let him be the one to kill Spider-Man. He then turns his target towards Dylan Brock and Normie. Spider-Man gets to his feet and defeats Norman. As more of the flashback is shown, Kindred states to Norman that he will leave now and will return when Norman is himself again so that they can confront the truth together. As Kindred starts to leave, Norman\\'s Kasady persona states to Kindred that he has a message for him from Norman who states that he is \"so proud of him\". Kindred takes his leave as Norman\\'s Kasady breaks out in maniacal laughter. [118] After the Grendel symbiote left Norman Osborn\\'s body, Norman regained conscious and escaped during the final showdown with Carnage. [119]  At some point, Norman\\'s mind recovered and he joined the Power Elite. [120]  In the pages of \"Ravencroft,\" Norman Osborn regained his sanity by blaming his actions on the Carnage symbiote to J.A.N.U.S. and became a consultant at Ravencroft at the behest of Mayor Wilson Fisk during it\\'s rebuilding. One of his assignments is to help John Jameson regain the ability to become Man-Wolf so that he can become an asset ranging from having Mister Hyde attack him to creating a clone of Ashley Kafka . In addition, Norman stole the Journal of Jonas Ravencroft to give to J.A.N.U.S. to use. When the Unwanted who lived beneath Ravencroft for years attacked, Norman succeeded in his goal to have John Jameson turn into Man-Wolf in order to fight the Unwanted. J.A.N.U.S.\\' leaders were pleased with Osborn\\'s success enabling them to use the items in the basement. [121]  During the \" Sins Rising \" arc, Mayor Wilson Fisk promoted Norman Osborn to becoming the Director of Ravencroft where he found himself being targeted by a resurrected Sin-Eater . [122] When Sin-Eater\\'s army of followers attacked Ravencroft, Norman was rescued by Spider-Man. [123] As Sin-Eater uses his abilities to steal the powers of Mister Negative to corrupt the guards, Norman takes Spider-Man to a bunker in his old cell and finds the items within them gone as the footage as he sees a corrupted Kafka be used to free Juggernaut so that he can steal his powers. Norman reveals that he was planning to use the weapons to counter Kindred who is after both of them. This leads to Norman removing a fake wall containing Green Goblin weaponry ready for combat. [124] Using Juggernaut\\'s powers, Sin-Eater and his followers pursue Spider-Man and Norman Osborn as the Order of the Web considers waiting for Sin-Eater to cleanse Norman Osborn before intervening. As Spider-Man and Norman Osborn escape underground, Sin-Eater catches up to them. As Spider-Man holds onto Sin-Eater to restrain him, Norman Osborn activates an EMP to liquefy the floor beneath them. After getting away, Norman tried to drown Spider-Man as he is saved by the Order of the Web. Upon identifying Ghost-Spider as an alternate version of Gwen Stacy and his plans to do what he did to the other Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man threw him out of the vehicle thery were in. [125]  At the start of the \" Last Remains \" arc, Sin-Eater catches up to Norman Osborn and uses his gun to purge him of his sins. When Norman Osborn recovered, he was found by Kafka as most of Sin-Eater\\'s followers are arrested. While mentioning that Ravencroft is in bad shape, Kafka is told by a remorseful Norman his suspicion that Kindred is Harry Osborn. [126] Not wanting to give him to the police, Kafka brings Norman to her office where he confessed every bad thing that he has done in his life. When Norman still claims that Harry is Kindred and that he must find a way to stop him before he goes further down the path to vengeance, Kafka suggests to Norman that he should enlist someone who Harry would still listen to. [127] [128] When Mary Jane catches up to Norman Osborn and attacks him, Norman expressed his remorse for his sins that Sin-Eater purged him of which Ashley Kafka corroborated on. He claims to Mary Jane that Harry Osborn is Kindred to which Mary Jane claimed that she just saw Harry Osborn alive. [129] It turns out that Norman Osborn faked being purged of his sins as seen when he meets up with Mayor Wilson Fisk and his men. Norman and Mayor Fisk work on a plan to dispose of Kindred for what he did to them. [130] Norman Osborn contacts Mayor Wilson Fisk stating that Mary Jane Watson got through to Kindred. As Mary Jane offers her life in exchange for Kindred not killing the Order of the Web, Norman Osborn in his Green Goblin attire crashes the confrontation where he throws a Pumpkin Bomb near Mary Jane stating that the choice isn\\'t Kindred\\'s choice. Then Green Goblin gives Mayor Fisk the signal to activate the trap which causes the tomb to be engulfed by a supernatural darkness. [131] Prior to the confrontation with Kindred, Norman Osborn spoke to Mayor Wilson Fisk about Project Blank which was inspired by the Darkforce Dome that Hydra used during their takeover of the United States . They enlisted Spot to power it. Back in the present, Mary Jane revealed to Spider-Man that the Pumpkin Bomb that was thrown was a flash bomb version as Green Goblin secretly quotes to Spider-Man to evacuated his allies while wearing his mask so that Mayor Fisk won\\'t know his true identity. At Ravencroft, Kindred\\'s Darkforce casing is being kept together by magic while monitored by Ravencroft\\'s staff. After some persuasion to Mayor Fisk, Norman Osborn speaks to Kindred while mentioned that he was actually cleansed by Sin-Eater while voicing regret having birthed the sickness in Harry\\'s mind. Planning to redeem the Osborn name, Norman states to Kindred that he will find the truth that he talked about. Spider-Man arrives stating to Norman that he would like to talk to him. [132] Spider-Man states to Norman Osborn that whenever he is cured or rebounds, somebody always dies. Norman agrees with the question and states that he wants Spider-Man to help him keep Kindred from being harmed by Mayor Wilson Fisk. When Norman continues to ask for Spider-Man and Mary Jane\\'s help, Spider-Man beats him up and then walks out. [133]   Powers and abilities [ edit ]  Norman Osborn was turned into the Green Goblin by a chemical solution he had devised based upon a formula originally conceived by Professor Mendel Stromm . The process granted Osborn superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and stamina as well as a low-level rapid healing factor. [134] In addition to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman\\'s already-above average intellect, making him a bona fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of genetics , robotics , engineering , physics and applied chemistry . The goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations. [135]  Following his confrontation with the returned Spider-Man after his campaign against Otto Octavius in Spider-Man\\'s body, Osborn has been rid of the Goblin formula from his system and thus has lost his superhuman abilities, forcing him to rely on his intellect and other natural abilities. Otto\\'s anti-serum also prevents Osborn\\'s attempts of restoring his powers; ultimately he seeks to rid himself of it in hopes of having them again despite risking his health and sanity. [136] Norman bonded to the Carnage symbiote to use to expel the anti-serum from his body which restores his former powers in the process, but once more at the cost of his mind. In addition, the Carnage symbiote eliminates his physical scars including his features\\'. [111]  He has since claimed to have \\'perfected\\' the formula so that it will grant the subjects powers while also reverting those he chooses to a more basic mentality where they will accept his orders. [107]   Weapons of Green Goblin [ edit ]  Main article: Green Goblin §\\xa0Powers and abilities  The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He wears a green costume underneath bulletproof chainmail with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses. The Green Goblin\\'s trademark weapons are his pumpkin bombs and razor bats. As their name suggests, the bombs were designed with the appearance of jack-o\\'-lanterns . These varied in function from smoke bombs to traditional explosives, while the razor edged bat -shaped boomerangs -could cut through very durable surfaces and materials. The gloves of the Goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity at nearly 10,000 amps of an undetermined voltage. Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin. The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating the Goblin Glider. The Goblin Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman\\'s Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed the Goblin to carry a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick. [137]   Weapons as Iron Patriot [ edit ]  During the events of the \" Dark Reign \" storyline, Osborn created the Iron Patriot identity (an amalgam of Iron Man and Captain America) to cement his standing as a hero. As the Iron Patriot, he utilized an outdated version of Iron Man\\'s armor painted in Captain America\\'s colors. The armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in his helmet which allowed him to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While Iron Man\\'s armor utilized repulsor technology, Osborn\\'s design does not; all but one repulsor was destroyed as \"Oz is too stupid\" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system. Osborn\\'s star shaped Uni Beam projector on his chest (because of its shape) also has a less powerful output. [138]   Powers as Super-Adaptoid [ edit ]  Following his time in prison, A.I.M scientists converted Osborn into a Super-Adaptoid , capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such superpowered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him. [139] He could also levitate, and he was able to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two. [140]  He is known to have absorbed the abilities of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk\\'s size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does. [141]  However, Osborn had no control over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would automatically absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma . [142] After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead. [143]   Powers as Red Goblin [ edit ]  Main article: Symbiote (comics) §\\xa0Powers and abilities  After gaining control of the Carnage symbiote\\'s desire for mindless slaughter, Osborn has used it to form a new attire in the form of the \\'Red Goblin\\', which essentially resembles a red version of his Green Goblin outfit without the purple and green clothing, as well as a long tail and flaming breath. [144] With the symbiote, he can create his own Goblin Glider and what he terms \\'Carnage bombs\\', which are essentially pumpkin bombs that can actually talk to and bite their targets before exploding, as well as the Carnage symbiote\\'s traditional enhancements. [145] Due to the combination of the symbiote with the new Goblin formula injected into his system, Osborn is immune to the symbiote\\'s traditional weaknesses of fire and sound, although the touch of Anti-Venom is still dangerous to him. He also revived its ability to spread its constituent matter to others. [146]   Characterization [ edit ]  Norman Osborn has consistently been depicted with several unusual weaknesses related to his psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression, has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits, [147] and in some depictions, a multiple-personality disorder. For some of his early appearances, he and the Goblin were separate personalities; his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses, while his Norman Osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry. [49] Although the stress caused by his son\\'s failing health as Norman helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin, [148] this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead. Norman is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack of empathy for the lives of innocent people who stand between him and his objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies. [149]  Norman Osborn is shown to be severely manic depressive. [147] This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not under the direction of a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. [150] At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. [151] Previously, Osborn\\'s arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. [152] In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. [153] After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn\\'s sanity apparently restored but remains a villain. [136]  Superhuman psychiatrist  Leonard Samson says of Osborn: \"In clinical terms, the words psychotic and psychopathic are far from synonymous... but in Norman Osborn\\'s case, both apply. I\\'d characterise him as a bipolar psychotic with concurrent aspects of psychopathic megalomania and malignant narcissism. In layman\\'s terms, a lethal cocktail of intersecting personality disorders that makes him one of the most dangerous human beings on the planet\". [154] There are many examples of Osborn\\'s pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes. He often transfers blame for his shortcomings to others or claims that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father, likely due to the abusive nature of his own father. Having become the Goblin, he generally views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. He goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man\\'s identity, he claimed that, when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys, or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the Human Torch , despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man\\'s victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself. [155]  He also missed the opportunity to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. [156] Although he later formed the \\'Sinister Twelve\\' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted, despite Venom being more powerful than the Scorpion. [157] When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual\\xa0– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively\\xa0– only to receive the gift of madness instead, [158] subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. [159] During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn\\'t allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians  wouldn\\'t threaten his power. [160] Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn\\'s decision to further Loki\\'s own goals. [161] [162] During his attempted takeover of Earth\\'s superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn\\'s demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers. [163]  It has been shown that since having suppressed the rampaging Green Goblin personality and becoming the more dominant personality, Osborn has proven to be just as (if not more) evil and cruel. Osborn has demonstrated a high degree of sadism: while in prison, a guard once asked him for his advice in helping his critically ill wife; Osborn\\'s advice led her to a quicker and more agonizing death. [164] As director of H.A.M.M.E.R. , he directed his officers to shoot down an airplane full of innocent people just to see whether his enemy Pepper Potts was powerful enough to rescue the passengers with her Rescue armor. [165] His Goblin persona vied for control of his body, as depicted in the January 2010 issue of Dark Avengers , where he is shown writhing on the floor and imploring, apparently to himself, \"Why won\\'t this face come off...?\", and finally took over when Osborn\\'s Iron Patriot armor was defeated by Captain America and Iron Man at the end of the \" Siege \" arc. [166] Since being cured of the Goblin formula, Osborn claims that his sanity has also been restored. However, he has expressed satisfaction at plastic surgery that \\'restored\\' him to a twisted version of his original features, and intended to use a modified version of the formula to essentially \\'infect\\' the entire country of Symkaria to become goblin-level soldiers without the intellectual capacity to defy him. [107]   Other versions [ edit ]  A number of alternate universes in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on Osborn, in which the character\\'s origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting. [167]  Marvel 2099 depicts the Goblin as a radical trickster who wants to prove that Spider-Man (Miguel O\\'Hara) is in the pay of a megacorp. He has bat-like glider-wings and a bag of \"tricks\", similar to the 20th century version. He also has the ability to project illusions. [168] In Earth X , Osborn\\'s business ventures have completely taken over the United States. Citizens work in his businesses, shop in his stores and eat his food and is partially responsible for the deaths of the Avengers as he sent them to battle a now Super Intelligent Absorbing Man. [169] [170] In the Marvel Noir universe, Osborn is a former circus freak who was mistreated from the audience for his reptile-like skin disorder. This fueled his ambitions in earning his \"respect\" by becoming the major Crime Lord in New York. [171] The Ultimate Marvel  version of the character was an industrialist and scientist who is trying to perfect the Super Soldier drug for S.H.I.E.L.D. , an obsession that leads to the neglect of his wife and son. [172] [173]   1602 [ edit ]  In the Marvel: 1602 Pocket Universe, Norman Osborne appears as a major villain, attempting to find \"the Source\", which is guarded by the Natives of Roanoke Island , and utilize it to gain unimaginable power; to achieve his goal, Osborne allies with King James I of England and makes several attempts to create conflict between his fellow American colonists and the Natives. Ultimately, Osborne is captured and imprisoned in stocks after peace between the colonists and Natives resumes and the English are forced from America. [174]  In Spider-Man: 1602 , Osborne has been released from the stocks, and is now harbourmaster of Roanoke. When Peter Parquagh and Virginia Dare find evidence he is plotting against the natives again, he kills Virginia and exposes Peter\\'s secret identity as The Spider. He is sentenced to be sent back to England, where capital punishment is still practiced. When the Mayflower is attacked by the pirate Wilson Fisk , Osborne\\'s cell is hit by a cannonball. Covered in gangrenous wounds, his sentence is abandoned since he is not expected to live long enough to stand trial in England. He contacts the natural philosopher Henri Le Pym , asking to be cured in return for helping Pym acquire some of Peter\\'s blood for his experiments. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Le Pym\\'s attempts to cure Osborne mutate him into a winged, green-skinned creature, and he uses these powers to capture Parquagh. During his final battle with Parquagh (in which Osborne uses exploding spherical vials as projectiles in combat) he is killed by a crossbow bolt fired by Fisk\\'s first mate, the Bull\\'s Eye , who has also been hunting Parquagh. [175]   Age of Apocalypse [ edit ]  In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Norman Osborn, known as Red , is a terrorist traitor to the human race, a member of Apocalypse\\'s  Marauders along with Dirigible , the Owl and Arcade . Red, along with the rest of the Marauders, is eventually killed by Clint Barton and Gwen Stacy. [176]   Earth X [ edit ]  In the alternative future of Earth X , Norman Osborn\\'s business ventures have completely taken over the United States. Citizens work in his businesses, shop in his stores and eat his food. Norman is the prime economic power and de facto ruler of the country. The Terrigen Mists have shaped his face into a saner version of his Goblin mask. He is partially responsible for the deaths of the Avengers as he sent them to battle a now Super Intelligent Absorbing Man. The Enforcers and The Vulture seem to serve as his secret service. He is later used as a pawn for the Red Skull , until Spiders Man makes him think he\\'s with Gwen Stacy (in reality the Red Skull) who shoves him out the window where his foot catches on a flag and his neck snaps similar to how Gwen died. Unaware of the irony, Skull orders his corpse be brought back up so he can push him out again, just so he can make a \"splat\" sound. [177] [178]   Amalgam Comics [ edit ]  In the Amalgam Comics continuity, Green Goblin was combined with DC\\'s Two-Face to create the Two-Faced Goblin (Harvey Osborn). He originally looked like the Green Goblin when in costume and had Two-Face\\'s half-scarred face under his Goblin mask, but in Dark Claw Adventures #1, he was given a different design with a glider that looked like a giant coin. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   What The--?! [ edit ]  In Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham , Norman Osborn is a turkey and enemy to Spider-Ham calling himself the Green Gobbler.  Marvel Fairy Tales [ edit ]  In issue one of Spider-Man Fairy Tales (an adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood ) Osborn makes an appearance as one of the woodsmen in the employ of Jameson alongside Peter and Thompson . [179] Norman Osborn and Harry Osborn also appear in issue four of Spider-Man Fairy Tales , a gender-reversed retelling of the story of Cinderella . Norman is the cruel guardian of Peter Parker, and his coat of arms and armor have a goblin/pumpkin motif. [180]   Marvel Noir [ edit ]  In the Marvel Noir universe, Norman Osborn is a former circus freak who was mistreated by the audience for his reptile-like skin disorder. This fueled his ambitions in earning his \"respect\" by becoming the major Crime Lord in New York. He used a mask to hide his true appearance. Earning the name \"the Goblin\", he organized his group composing of former circus and carnival freak shows: Kraven the Hunter , Adrian Toomes, and Chameleon . The Goblin\\'s reputation earned him as a freelancer from among New York City\\'s politicians and businessmen in hired to commit illegal acts such as suppressing public protests and even acts of assassinations on public objectors. These actions eventually caused him to come into conflict with Spider-Man after he order The Vulture to kill the vigilante\\'s uncle . Later, reporter Ben Urich became a problem for Norman, so the mob boss sent The Chameleon dressed as J. Jonah Jameson to kill him as Osborn kidnapped the real one. After murdering Urich, the Chameleon was killed by Felicia Hardy . The Goblin then took Felicia to one of his hideouts, only for Spider-Man track him down. Norman escaped to the sewers with Hardy as Spider-Man was fighting Osborn\\'s thugs. During the battle, Kraven (one of the thugs) hit a glass full of spiders, causing the animals to fall on him. Spider-Man then saved Jameson and went after Osborn. New York City\\'s vigilante and its main mob boss fought until each one of them got unmasked, Spider-Man was revealed to be Peter Parker and Osborn reveals his green and scaled skin to him. Parker decides not to kill Norman, however a spider-infested Kraven then shows up and attacks Osborn, apparently killing him.  In other media [ edit ]  The Noir version of Norman Osborn appears in the video game Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions , voiced by Jim Cummings . He tasks his enforcers Hammerhead and the Vulture with retrieving all of the fragments of the Tablet of Order and Chaos in New York. Although Spider-Man manages to keep most of them out of his hands, Osborn eventually does obtain one and absorbs its power, transforming him into a monstrous form (similar to his Ultimate counterpart) with sheer levels of strength. Despite this, the process opens up a massive sore on his back that becomes his only weak point. He then lures Spider-Man to his carnival hideout, using hostages as bait. There, Spider-Man finally defeats the Goblin and claims his fragment.  Marvel Zombies [ edit ]  In the Marvel Zombies universe, a zombified Green Goblin appears attacking Galactus alongside several other undead supervillains. [181] Also in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days , the zombified Green Goblin, alongside several other undead Spider-Man villains, appears to attack Wolverine and Magneto as the two are saving innocent civilians from zombies. An alternative version of the Green Goblin was also infected by a zombified Spider-Man , causing him to \"participate\" with other zombie members of the Sinister 6 into devouring Peter\\'s friends. Grieving, dumb, angered, and devastated, the Zombie Spider-Man obliterates him along with the other undead Sinister 6 members. [182]   MC2 [ edit ]  In the MC2 universe, Norman Osborn is very much the same character from his 1996-1999 portion of the original 616 timeline, only in this universe, he abducts Peter\\'s daughter Mayday Parker and leaves her in the care of Allison Mongraine. However, Peter\\'s wayward original clone Kaine , along with a remorseful Mongraine, returns baby May to the Parkers. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Two years later, Norman would attempt to gain incredible power through the Gathering of Five, but in a final battle with Spider-Man, Osborn is slain in an explosion that also severely injures Peter, costing him one of his legs. [183]  May would later become a hero in her own right, Spider-Girl . [184]  After discovering a living twin of May Parker (kept in suspended animation) among his grandfather\\'s possessions, Normie Osborn wondered whether it was a clone or whether the original Goblin had put the real May in suspended animation and arranged for her parents to receive a clone of May to raise. He visited Élan in prison and questioned her about this, but she refused to say anything. She was then later broken out of jail by an unknown benefactor, then she released the clone May on to the world and towards the original May. She also had Peter Parker kidnapped and brainwashed into thinking he was Norman Osborn. [185] The brainwashed Peter joins with the May clone, who is half symbiote , and becomes the Goblin God . [186] It is through this brainwashing that Norman Osborn\\'s consciousness resurfaces. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  In a psychic duel, Peter, Mayday, the clone and the spirit of Aunt May defeated Norman\\'s psychic representation, which in turn cured Peter of his condition, ending Osborn\\'s threat yet again. [187]   Newspaper strip [ edit ]  In The Amazing Spider-Man newspaper strip by Stan Lee and Larry Leiber a brief flashback showed Spider-Man fighting the Green Goblin, designed similarly to the version in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films, to save Mary Jane. [ citation needed ]  A later story showing Harry Osborn as the Hobgoblin flashed back to Norman Osborn\\'s death in a battle against Spider-Man and showed Harry\\'s realization that his father was the murderous Green Goblin. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Infinity Warps [ edit ]  During Infinity Wars , when the universe was folded, Norman Osborn got fused with Jack Russell to create Goblin by Night . Norman Russell was cursed to be the Goblin by Night and killed Ben Spector, May Spector and nearly killed Peter Spector leaving Peter to become ArachKnight . During a battle with Peter, Norman was injured and was saved by his son, Harry Russell. While Harry was taking care of his father, Norman lost control and bit Harry, passing the curse to him. Harry now as the new Goblin by Night, starts using the Glider that Peter built for him prior to becoming the Goblin, leaving Norman free from the curse and being forgiven by Peter and decide to find a way to cure Harry. [188]   Spider-Man: Clone Saga [ edit ]  In the retelling of the Clone Saga by Tom DeFalco, Norman did not survive his battle with Spider-Man following the death of Gwen Stacy. The Jackal plans to clone him as a plot to torment Ben Reilly and Peter Parker (though they are not aware of this) before he is murdered by Kaine. However, Harry Osborn , who is still alive in this reality, manages to obtain the clone pod and releases Norman. This clone is quite sane due to never being exposed to the goblin formula, and he makes repeated efforts to convince his insane son to stop his maniacal plans. He ultimately sacrifices himself to save the Parkers and baby May from Harry, who swears vengeance. [189]   Spider-Man: Life Story [ edit ]  Spider-Man: Life Story features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age when Peter debuted as Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Osborn loses his memories as the Green Goblin shortly after a fight with Spider-Man. While initially fearful of Osborn getting his memory back and revealing his secret identity, Peter later gives an anonymous tip to the police to get Osborn arrested and prevent the Green Goblin from hurting anyone. In 1977, the still imprisoned Norman convinces Harry to suit up as the Black Goblin to steal \"The Gemini Project\" from Miles Warren, which is revealed to be a clone of himself. Harry discovers that Miles also cloned Peter and Gwen Stacy and deduces that Norman cloned Peter because he still considered Peter the more worthy heir. After Peter convinces Harry of his father\\'s manipulations, Harry blows up the containment tubes the clones were in, killing all of them except for Peter\\'s clone. However, Miles reveals that the Gwen in the containment tube was actually the real Gwen. Norman is eventually released from prison and feigns his old age affecting his mental state before disappearing from the public. In 1995, he reveals Spider-Man\\'s secret identity and information about his clone Ben Reilly to Doctor Octopus, who kidnaps them and threatens Harry into using Oscorp technology to study a way to clone himself. In the process, he discovers that Peter is supposedly the clone while Ben is the original. In the ensuing chaos, Doctor Octopus kills Harry after attempting to kill Peter and Ben. Peter allows Ben to take over his life in New York before tracking down Norman to an industrial area in New Jersey with Jessica Jones \\' help. Peter reveals he kept tabs on Norman after he was released from prison and knew Norman rigged the machines to trick Peter into thinking he was the clone. After learning of Harry\\'s death from Peter, Norman blames Peter for the incident and tries to attack him, but then dies in his old age cursing Spider-Man. [190]   Spider-Verse [ edit ]  There are different versions of Green Goblin in the Spider-Verse storyline:  A version of the Sinister Six appears in Earth-803 calling themselves as the \"Six Men of Sinestry\" and is led by Norman Osborn under the disguise of Green Goblin. They battled Lady Spider and were forced to withdraw when they lost the upper hand, but they succeed in stealing the mayor\\'s plans. [191]  In Earth-21205, the Green Goblin is murdered by Peter Parker in rage, resulting in Peter being the Hobgoblin due to the trauma of Gwen Stacy \\'s death . [192]  In Earth-138, Norman \"Ozzy\" Osborn is president of America and leads to wipe out the Anarchic Spider-Man and his Spider-Army. His company Oscorp created Variable Engagement Neuro-sensitive Organic Mesh or V.E.N.O.M. which is used by the Thunderbolt Department, the police and fire department of his regime.  He and his Thunderbolt Department were defeated in the battle with Spider-Punk, Spider-Punk smashing Osborn\\'s stomach with a guitar. [193]  In Earth-3145 where Spider-Man is Ben Parker , the Goblin version is called the Emerald Elf and was briefly shown in a flashback sequence as the killer of Ben\\'s family. He is presumably killed when a scheme by Doctor Octopus resulted in a nuclear apocalypse. [194]  Different versions of the Goblin\\'s identity appear including a Green Goblin which is part of Verna \\'s Hounds . [194] They are killed by Assassin Spider-Man, Superior Spider-Man, and Spider-Punk.  Ultimate Marvel [ edit ]  Main article: Green Goblin (Ultimate Marvel character)  The Ultimate Marvel version of Norman Osborn is a corrupt industrialist and scientist who is trying to perfect the Super Soldier drug for S.H.I.E.L.D. , an obsession that leads to the neglect of his wife Martha Osborn and son Harry Osborn . When an OZ -injected spider bites Peter Parker on a field trip, [195] and develops amazing abilities, Norman theorizes that if the OZ combined with spider DNA were behind Parker\\'s abilities of a spider, then Norman with OZ combined with his own DNA would become a heightened version of himself. But his experiment goes wrong, [196] and he himself is transformed into a muscular, grotesque, goblin-looking monster , granting him superhuman strength, reflexes, stamina, speed and durability, and enabling him to leap great distances. He is also pyrokinetic, as he can throw flaming balls of destructive energy. His alter-ego is later referred to as the \"Green Goblin\" by the public.  Spider-Man Unlimited [ edit ]  The Spider-Man Unlimited comics that tie in with the series depict the Green Goblin\\'s first encounter with Spider-Man, and their rescue of several Beastials and humans from Venom and Carnage\\'s cluthces. [197] Later, the Goblin helps Spider-Man look in the sewers for the missing people that were kidnapped by an octopus-like creature. They fight the creature that took them to a place called \"Heaven\" where they were taken hostage by the villagers, but were rescued by a Counter-Earth version of Gwen Stacy that lived in this village. [198]   Gold Goblin [ edit ]  In the New Exiles comic series, Norman Osborn of Earth-812145 of the Marvel Universe is an insane criminal called The Gold Goblin . The Gold Goblin was stopped by the Exiles after he began to wreak havoc on his home world. [199]   Spider-Geddon [ edit ]  In the Spider-Geddon storyline, Norman Osborn of Earth-44145 is a six-armed version of Spider-Man . As Norman is informed of his son Harry Osborn moving through Oscorp and having been secretly armed, he is told that Harry is on the 15th floor near Mr. Warren\\'s lab. Being Spider-Man and arriving where a warped Cosmic Cube is located, Norman confronts Harry who dons the Kobold armor. It was revealed during the fight that Norman killed Peter Parker as Harry fires a laser beam at the warped Cosmic Cube. As Oscorp starts to disintegrate, Norman is pleased that Harry finally gave him what he wanted by accidentally giving him access to the multiverse. Just then, Spider-Punk arrives and pulls Norman much to his dismay. [200] Norman is among the spider-powered characters that are on Superior Spider-Man \\'s team. After Superior Spider-Man\\'s group rescues Miles Morales \\'s group from the Inheritors at the New U Technologies building, Norman has a talk with Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 about his vision on the Web of Life and Destiny as they have a secret strategy to keep the Inheritors on Earth-616 . [201] After destroying the Web of Life along with Spiders-Man, he is seen holding a piece of the Web inside a container with an evil smile on his face. [202] In the 2019 Superior Spider-Man series, he reappears on Earth-616, along with Spiders-Man who had been spying on Otto Octavius, while Norman plans his revenge. [203]  In Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors , Norman Osborn as Green Goblin (voiced by Steven Weber ) further mutates himself into the Spider-Goblin after splicing himself with the DNA of interdimensional Spider-Men.  In Marvel\\'s Spider-Man , Norman Osborn (voiced by Josh Keaton ) eventually mutates into the Spider King due to exposure to Raymond Warren \\'s spider virus .  During the return of the Inheritors, Spider-Gwen\\'s device to travel through the multiverse got destroyed by Verna and then Spider-Gwen got stranded in an alternate universe. [204] In this universe, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy got a job at Oscorp and Peter wanted to create a cure for severe illness. Peter was experimenting with spider venom to create the cure but one of the spiders bit Harry Osborn instead, and thus is this universe\\'s Spider-Man. Harry alongside Gwen as this universe\\'s Green Goblin started to fight crime together, until during a fight with the Sandman, both Harry and Gwen\\'s father got killed. After that, Gwen lost all of memories, forgetting about Peter and Mary Jane. [205]  On Earth-11580, another version of Green Goblin is seen alongside Hobgoblin , Demogoblin and Jack O\\'Lantern during the Goblin Night. Under the Goblin Queen \\'s orders, they try to kill Gwen Stacy , but Spiders-Man arrives and defeats the Goblins. [206]  What If? [ edit ]  Dark Reign: Infinity Gauntlet [ edit ]  In an alternate reality, Osborn acquired the Infinity Gems after manipulating an army of villains to do the work for him and used them to reassemble the Infinity Gauntlet, defeating most of the heroes while trapping Spider-Man in a time loop where he witnesses/\"causes\" Gwen Stacy\\'s death over and over again. However, when Norman uses the Gauntlet\\'s power to resurrect his abusive father to show him what he has accomplished, his father dismisses him as a petty tyrant and a monster until Norman uses the Gauntlet to change his father\\'s opinion. When Thanos appears, killing the rest of the Dark Avengers while taunting Osborn about the hollow nature of his father\\'s current approval, Osborn destroys him, but when his altered father only says that he loves Norman as a son, Osborn erases him in a fit of anger as he wanted to be praised for his accomplishments, realizing too late that erasing his father automatically erases him as well.

In 2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment , Marvel Worldwide\\'s parent company. Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman under a number of corporations and imprints but now known as Timely Comics , [3] and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics . The Marvel era began in 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee , Jack Kirby , Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years, was solidified as the company\\'s primary brand. Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man , Iron Man , Captain America , the Hulk , Thor , Wolverine , Ant-Man , the Wasp , Black Widow , Captain Marvel , Black Panther , Doctor Strange , the Scarlet Witch , the Vision , Ghost Rider , Blade , Daredevil , the Punisher and Deadpool . Superhero teams exist such as the Avengers , the X-Men , the Fantastic Four and the Guardians of the Galaxy as well as supervillains including Doctor Doom , Magneto , Thanos , Loki , Green Goblin , Kingpin , Red Skull , Ultron , the Mandarin , MODOK , Doctor Octopus , Kang , Dormammu , Venom and Galactus . Most of Marvel\\'s fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe , with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in New York City . [4] Additionally, Marvel has published several licensed properties from other companies. This includes Star Wars comics twice from 1977 to 1986 and again since 2015.

Cover art by Frank R. Paul .  Pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939. [5] [6] Goodman, who had started with a Western pulp in 1933, was expanding into the emerging—and by then already highly popular—new medium of comic books. Launching his new line from his existing company\\'s offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the titles of editor , managing editor , and business manager , with Abraham Goodman (Martin\\'s brother) [7] officially listed as publisher. [6]  Timely\\'s first publication, Marvel Comics #1 ( cover dated Oct. 1939), included the first appearance of Carl Burgos \\' android  superhero the Human Torch , and the first appearances of Bill Everett \\'s anti-hero  Namor the Sub-Mariner , [8] among other features. [5] The issue was a great success; it and a second printing the following month sold a combined nearly 900,000 copies. [9] While its contents came from an outside packager, Funnies, Inc. , [5] Timely had its own staff in place by the following year. The company\\'s first true editor, writer-artist Joe Simon , teamed with artist Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes, [10]  Captain America , in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with sales of nearly one million. [9] Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941. [3] [11]  While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these three characters, some notable heroes—many of which continue to appear in modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacks—include the Whizzer , Miss America , the Destroyer , the original Vision , and the Angel . Timely also published one of humor cartoonist Basil Wolverton \\'s best-known features, \" Powerhouse Pepper \", [12] [13] as well as a line of children\\'s funny-animal comics featuring characters like Super Rabbit and the duo Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal . Goodman hired his wife\\'s 16-year-old cousin, [14] Stanley Lieber, as a general office assistant in 1939. [15] When editor Simon left the company in late 1941, [16] Goodman made Lieber—by then writing pseudonymously as \" Stan Lee \"—interim editor of the comics line, a position Lee kept for decades except for three years during his military service in World War II . Lee wrote extensively for Timely, contributing to a number of different titles. Goodman\\'s business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff. [3] One of these shell companies through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least Marvel Mystery Comics #55 (May 1944). As well, some comics\\' covers, such as All Surprise Comics #12 (Winter 1946–47), were labeled \"A Marvel Magazine\" many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 1961. [17]   Atlas Comics [ edit ]  Main article: Atlas Comics (1950s)  The post-war American comic market saw superheroes falling out of fashion. [18] Goodman\\'s comic book line dropped them for the most part and expanded into a wider variety of genres than even Timely had published, featuring horror , Westerns , humor, funny animal , men\\'s adventure -drama, giant monster, crime , and war comics , and later adding jungle books, romance titles, espionage , and even medieval adventure, Bible stories and sports. Goodman began using the globe logo of the Atlas News Company, the newsstand-distribution company he owned, [19] on comics cover-dated November 1951 even though another company, Kable News, continued to distribute his comics through the August 1952 issues. [20] This globe branding united a line put out by the same publisher, staff and freelancers through 59 shell companies, from Animirth Comics to Zenith Publications. [21]  Atlas, rather than innovate, took a proven route of following popular trends in television and movies— Westerns and war dramas prevailing for a time, drive-in movie monsters another time—and even other comic books, particularly the EC  horror line. [22] Atlas also published a plethora of children\\'s and teen humor titles, including Dan DeCarlo \\'s Homer the Happy Ghost (similar to Casper the Friendly Ghost ) and Homer Hooper (à la Archie Andrews ). Atlas unsuccessfully attempted to revive superheroes from late 1953 to mid-1954, with the Human Torch (art by Syd Shores and Dick Ayers , variously), the Sub-Mariner (drawn and most stories written by Bill Everett ), and Captain America (writer Stan Lee , artist John Romita Sr. ). Atlas did not achieve any breakout hits and, according to Stan Lee, Atlas survived chiefly because it produced work quickly, cheaply, and at a passable quality. [23]    The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961). Cover art by Jack Kirby (penciler) and unconfirmed inker.  Marvel Comics [ edit ]  The first modern comic books under the Marvel Comics brand were the science-fiction anthology Journey into Mystery #69 and the teen-humor title Patsy Walker #95 (both cover dated June 1961), which each displayed an \"MC\" box on its cover. [24] Then, in the wake of DC Comics \\' success in reviving superheroes in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly with the Flash , Green Lantern , Batman , Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow and other members of the team the Justice League of America , Marvel followed suit. [n 1]  In 1961, writer-editor Stan Lee revolutionized superhero comics by introducing superheroes designed to appeal to older readers than the predominantly child audiences of the medium, thus ushering what Marvel later called the Marvel Age of Comics . [25] Modern Marvel\\'s first superhero team, the titular stars of The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961), [26] broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling, holding grudges both deep and petty, and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. Subsequently, Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them, a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated. [27] This applied to The Amazing Spider-Man title in particular, which turned out to be Marvel\\'s most successful book. Its young hero suffered from self-doubt and mundane problems like any other teenager, something with which many readers could identify. Stan Lee and freelance artist and eventual co-plotter Jack Kirby \\'s Fantastic Four originated in a Cold War culture that led their creators to revise the superhero conventions of previous eras to better reflect the psychological spirit of their age. [28] Eschewing such comic-book tropes as secret identities and even costumes at first, having a monster as one of the heroes, and having its characters bicker and complain in what was later called a \"superheroes in the real world\" approach, the series represented a change that proved to be a great success. [29]  Marvel often presented flawed superheroes, freaks, and misfits—unlike the perfect, handsome, athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books. Some Marvel heroes looked like villains and monsters such as the Hulk and the Thing . This naturalistic approach even extended into topical politics. Comics historian Mike Benton also noted:  .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} In the world of [rival DC Comics \\'] Superman comic books, communism did not exist. Superman rarely crossed national borders or involved himself in political disputes. [30] From 1962 to 1965, there were more communists [in Marvel Comics] than on the subscription list of Pravda . Communist agents attack Ant-Man in his laboratory, red henchmen jump the Fantastic Four on the moon, and Viet Cong guerrillas take potshots at Iron Man. [31]  All these elements struck a chord with the older readers, including college-aged adults. In 1965, Spider-Man and the Hulk were both featured in Esquire magazine\\'s list of 28 college campus heroes, alongside John F. Kennedy and Bob Dylan . [32] In 2009, writer Geoff Boucher reflected that,   Superman and DC Comics instantly seemed like boring old Pat Boone ; Marvel felt like The Beatles and the British Invasion . It was Kirby\\'s artwork with its tension and psychedelia that made it perfect for the times—or was it Lee\\'s bravado and melodrama, which was somehow insecure and brash at the same time? [33]    In addition to Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four, Marvel began publishing further superhero titles featuring such heroes and antiheroes as the Hulk , Thor , Ant-Man , Iron Man , the X-Men , Daredevil , the Inhumans , Black Panther , Doctor Strange , Captain Marvel and the Silver Surfer , and such memorable antagonists as Doctor Doom , Magneto , Galactus , Loki , the Green Goblin , and Doctor Octopus , all existing in a shared reality known as the Marvel Universe , with locations that mirror real-life cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Marvel even lampooned itself and other comics companies in a parody comic, Not Brand Echh (a play on Marvel\\'s dubbing of other companies as \"Brand Echh\", à la the then-common phrase \"Brand X\"). [34]    Cover of The Avengers #4 (Mar 1964), featuring the return of Captain America . Art by Jack Kirby .  Cadence Industries ownership [ edit ]  In 1968, while selling 50\\xa0million comic books a year, company founder Goodman revised the constraining distribution arrangement with Independent News he had reached under duress during the Atlas years, allowing him now to release as many titles as demand warranted. [19] Late that year, he sold Marvel Comics and its parent company, Magazine Management, to the Perfect Film and Chemical Corporation , with Goodman remaining as publisher. [35] In 1969, Goodman finally ended his distribution deal with Independent by signing with Curtis Circulation Company . [19]  In 1971, the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare approached Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee to do a comic book story about drug abuse. Lee agreed and wrote a three-part Spider-Man story portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. However, the industry\\'s self-censorship board, the Comics Code Authority , refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics, deeming the context of the story irrelevant. Lee, with Goodman\\'s approval, published the story regardless in The Amazing Spider-Man #96–98 (May–July 1971), without the Comics Code seal. The market reacted well to the storyline, and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year. [36]  Goodman retired as publisher in 1972 and installed his son, Chip, as publisher. [37] Shortly thereafter, Lee succeeded him as publisher and also became Marvel\\'s president [37] for a brief time. [38] During his time as president, he appointed his associate editor, prolific writer Roy Thomas , as editor-in-chief. Thomas added \"Stan Lee Presents\" to the opening page of each comic book. [37]    Howard the Duck #8 (Jan. 1977). Cover art by Gene Colan and Steve Leialoha  A series of new editors-in-chief oversaw the company during another slow time for the industry. Once again, Marvel attempted to diversify, and with the updating of the Comics Code published titles themed to horror ( The Tomb of Dracula ), martial arts ( Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu ), sword-and-sorcery ( Conan the Barbarian in 1970, [39]  Red Sonja ), satire ( Howard the Duck ) and science fiction ( 2001: A Space Odyssey , \" Killraven \" in Amazing Adventures , Battlestar Galactica , Star Trek , and, late in the decade, the long-running Star Wars series). Some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines, under its Curtis Magazines imprint. Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line. Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in 1972, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux. [40] Goodman increased the price and size of Marvel\\'s November 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages. DC followed suit, but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages, offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount. [41]  In 1973, Perfect Film and Chemical renamed itself as Cadence Industries and renamed Magazine Management as Marvel Comics Group. [42] Goodman, now disconnected from Marvel, set up a new company called Seaboard Periodicals in 1974, reviving Marvel\\'s old Atlas name for a new Atlas Comics line, but this lasted only a year and a half. [43] In the mid-1970s a decline of the newsstand distribution network affected Marvel. Cult hits such as Howard the Duck fell victim to the distribution problems, with some titles reporting low sales when in fact the first specialty comic book stores resold them at a later date. [ citation needed ] But by the end of the decade, Marvel\\'s fortunes were reviving, thanks to the rise of direct market distribution—selling through those same comics-specialty stores instead of newsstands. Marvel ventured into audio in 1975 with a radio series and a record, both had Stan Lee as narrator. The radio series was Fantastic Four . The record was Spider-Man: Rock Reflections of a Superhero concept album for music fans. [44]    Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #1 (May 1984). Cover art by Mike Zeck depicting Captain America, Wolverine, Cyclops, Hawkeye, Rogue, She-Hulk, The Thing, Colossus, Monica Rambeau, Nightcrawler, Spider-Man, Human Torch, Hulk, Iron Man and Storm. [45]  Marvel held its own comic book convention , Marvelcon \\'75, in spring 1975, and promised a Marvelcon \\'76. At the 1975 event, Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Jack Kirby , the artist co-creator of most of Marvel\\'s signature characters, was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for rival DC Comics . [46] In October 1976, Marvel, which already licensed reprints in different countries, including the UK, created a superhero specifically for the British market. Captain Britain debuted exclusively in the UK, and later appeared in American comics. [47] During this time, Marvel and the Iowa-based Register and Tribune Syndicate launched a number of syndicated comic strips — The Amazing Spider-Man , Howard the Duck , Conan the Barbarian , and The Incredible Hulk . None of the strips lasted past 1982, except for The Amazing Spider-Man , which is still being published. In 1978, Jim Shooter became Marvel\\'s editor-in-chief. Although a controversial personality, Shooter cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel, including repeatedly missed deadlines.  During Shooter\\'s nine-year tenure as editor-in-chief, Chris Claremont and John Byrne \\'s run on the Uncanny X-Men and Frank Miller \\'s run on Daredevil became critical and commercial successes. [48] Shooter brought Marvel into the rapidly evolving direct market , [49] institutionalized creator royalties, starting with the Epic Comics imprint for creator-owned material in 1982; introduced company-wide crossover story arcs with Contest of Champions and Secret Wars ; and in 1986 launched the ultimately unsuccessful New Universe line to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Marvel Comics imprint. Star Comics , a children-oriented line differing from the regular Marvel titles, was briefly successful during this period.  Marvel Entertainment Group ownership [ edit ]  In 1986, Marvel\\'s parent, Marvel Entertainment Group , was sold to New World Entertainment , which within three years sold it to MacAndrews and Forbes , owned by Revlon executive Ronald Perelman in 1989. In 1991 Perelman took MEG public. Following the rapid rise of this stock, Perelman issued a series of junk bonds that he used to acquire other entertainment companies, secured by MEG stock. [50]    Marvel\\'s logo, circa 1990s.  Marvel earned a great deal of money with their 1980s children\\'s comics imprint Star Comics and they earned a great deal more money and worldwide success during the comic book boom of the early 1990s, launching the successful 2099 line of comics set in the future ( Spider-Man 2099 , etc.) and the creatively daring though commercially unsuccessful Razorline imprint of superhero comics created by novelist and filmmaker Clive Barker . [51] [52] In 1990, Marvel began selling Marvel Universe Cards with trading card maker SkyBox International . These were collectible trading cards that featured the characters and events of the Marvel Universe. The 1990s saw the rise of variant covers , cover enhancements, swimsuit issues , and company-wide crossovers that affected the overall continuity of the Marvel Universe .   Spider-Man #1, later renamed \"Peter Parker: Spider-Man\" (August 1990; second printing). Cover art by Todd McFarlane .  Marvel suffered a blow in early 1992, when seven of its most prized artists — Todd McFarlane (known for his work on Spider-Man ), Jim Lee ( X-Men ), Rob Liefeld ( X-Force ), Marc Silvestri ( Wolverine ), Erik Larsen ( The Amazing Spider-Man ), Jim Valentino ( Guardians of the Galaxy ), and Whilce Portacio ( Uncanny X-Men ) — left to form Image Comics [53] in a deal brokered by Malibu Comics \\' owner Scott Mitchell Rosenberg . [54] Three years later Rosenberg sold Malibu to Marvel on November 3, 1994, [55] [56] [57] who  acquired the then-leading standard for computer coloring of comic books (developed by Rosenberg) in the process, [58] but also integrating the Ultraverse into Marvel\\'s multiverse and ownership of the Genesis Universe . In late 1994, Marvel acquired the comic book distributor Heroes World Distribution to use as its own exclusive distributor. [59] As the industry\\'s other major publishers made exclusive distribution deals with other companies, the ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major distributor in North America, Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. [60] [61] Then, by the middle of the decade, the industry had slumped, and in December 1996 MEG filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. [50] In early 1997, when Marvel\\'s Heroes World endeavor failed, Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with Marvel [62] —giving the company its own section of its comics catalog Previews . [63]  In 1996, Marvel had some of its titles participate in \" Heroes Reborn \", a crossover that allowed Marvel to relaunch some of its flagship characters such as the Avengers and the Fantastic Four , and outsource them to the studios of two of the former Marvel artists turned Image Comics founders, Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld. The relaunched titles, which saw the characters transported to a parallel universe with a history distinct from the mainstream Marvel Universe, were a solid success amidst a generally struggling industry, [64] but Marvel discontinued the experiment after a one-year run and returned the characters to the Marvel Universe proper.  Marvel Enterprises [ edit ]  In 1997, Toy Biz bought Marvel Entertainment Group to end the bankruptcy, forming a new corporation, Marvel Enterprises . [50] With his business partner Avi Arad , publisher Bill Jemas , and editor-in-chief Bob Harras , Toy Biz co-owner Isaac Perlmutter helped stabilize the comics line. [65]  In 1998, the company launched the imprint Marvel Knights , taking place just outside Marvel continuity with better production quality. The imprint was helmed by soon-to-become editor-in-chief Joe Quesada ; it featured tough, gritty stories showcasing such characters as the Daredevil , [66]  Inhumans and Black Panther . With the new millennium, Marvel Comics emerged from bankruptcy and again began diversifying its offerings. In 2001, Marvel withdrew from the Comics Code Authority and established its own Marvel Rating System for comics. The first title from this era to not have the code was X-Force #119 (October 2001). Marvel also created new imprints , such as MAX (an explicit-content line) and Marvel Adventures (developed for child audiences). In addition, the company created an alternate universe imprint, Ultimate Marvel , that allowed the company to reboot its major titles by revising and updating its characters to introduce to a new generation. Some of its characters have been turned into successful film franchises, such as the Men in Black movie series, starting in 1997, Blade movie series, starting in 1998, X-Men movie series, starting in 2000, and the highest grossing series Spider-Man , beginning in 2002. [67]  Marvel\\'s Conan the Barbarian title stopped in 1993 after 275 issues. The Savage Sword of Conan magazine had 235 issues. Marvel published additional titles including miniseries until 2000 for a total of 650 issues. Conan was pick up by Dark Horse three years later. [39]  In a cross-promotion, the November 1, 2006, episode of the CBS soap opera The Guiding Light , titled \"She\\'s a Marvel\", featured the character Harley Davidson Cooper (played by Beth Ehlers ) as a superheroine named the Guiding Light. [68] The character\\'s story continued in an eight-page backup feature, \"A New Light\", that appeared in several Marvel titles published November 1 and 8. [69] Also that year, Marvel created a wiki on its Web site. [70]  In late 2007 the company launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited , a digital archive of over 2,500 back issues available for viewing, for a monthly or annual subscription fee. [71] At the December 2007 the NY Anime Fest, the company announcement that Del Rey Manga would published two original English language Marvel manga books featuring the X-Men and Wolverine to hit the stands in spring 2009. [72]  In 2009 Marvel Comics closed its Open Submissions Policy, in which the company had accepted unsolicited samples from aspiring comic book artists, saying the time-consuming review process had produced no suitably professional work. [73] The same year, the company commemorated its 70th anniversary, dating to its inception as Timely Comics , by issuing the one-shot Marvel Mystery Comics 70th Anniversary Special #1 and a variety of other special issues. [74] [75]   Disney conglomerate unit (2009–present) [ edit ]   Writers of Marvel titles in the 2010s include (seated left to right) Ed Brubaker , Christos Gage , Matt Fraction , and Brian Michael Bendis .  On August 31, 2009, The Walt Disney Company announced it would acquire Marvel Comics\\' parent corporation, Marvel Entertainment, for a cash and stock deal worth approximately $4\\xa0billion, which if necessary would be adjusted at closing, giving Marvel shareholders $30 and 0.745 Disney shares for each share of Marvel they owned. [76] [77] As of 2008, Marvel and its major, longtime competitor DC Comics shared over 80% of the American comic-book market. [78]  As of September 2010, Marvel switched its bookstores distribution company from Diamond Book Distributors to Hachette Distribution Services . [79] Marvel moved its office to the Sports Illustrated Building in October 2010. [80]  Marvel relaunched the CrossGen imprint, owned by Disney Publishing Worldwide , in March 2011. [81] Marvel and Disney Publishing began jointly publishing Disney/Pixar Presents magazine that May. [82]  Marvel discontinued its Marvel Adventures imprint in March 2012, [83] and replaced them with a line of two titles connected to the Marvel Universe TV block . [84] Also in March, Marvel announced its Marvel ReEvolution initiative that included Infinite Comics, [85] a line of digital comics , Marvel AR, a software application that provides an augmented reality experience to readers and Marvel NOW! , a relaunch of most of the company\\'s major titles with different creative teams. [86] [87] Marvel NOW! also saw the debut of new flagship titles including Uncanny Avengers and All-New X-Men . [88]  In April 2013, Marvel and other Disney conglomerate components began announcing joint projects. With ABC , a Once Upon a Time graphic novel was announced for publication in September. [89] With Disney, Marvel announced in October 2013 that in January 2014 it would release its first title under their joint \"Disney Kingdoms\" imprint \"Seekers of the Weird\", a five-issue miniseries. [90] On January 3, 2014, fellow Disney subsidiary Lucasfilm announced that as of 2015, Star Wars comics would once again be published by Marvel. [91]  Following the events of the company-wide crossover \" Secret Wars \" in 2015, a relaunched Marvel universe began in September 2015, called the All-New, All-Different Marvel . [92]  Marvel Legacy was the company\\'s Fall 2017 relaunch banner starting in September. The banner had comics with lenticular variant covers which required comic book stores to double their regular issue order to be able to order the variants. The owner of two Comix Experience stores complained about the set up of forcing retailers to be stuck with copies they cannot sell for the variant that they can sell. With other complaints too, Marvel did adjust down requirements for new titles no adjustment was made for any other. [ incomprehensible ] Thusforthly MyComicShop.com and at least 70 other comic book stores were boycotting these variant covers. [93] Despite the release of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , Logan , Thor: Ragnarok and Spider-Man: Homecoming in theaters, none of those characters\\' titles featured in the top 10 sales and the Guardians of the Galaxy comic book series was cancelled. [94] Conan Properties International announced on January 12, 2018 that Conan would return to Marvel in early 2019. [39]  On March 1, 2019, Serial Box , a digital book platform, announced a partnership with Marvel. They will publish new and original stories that will be tied to a number of Marvel\\'s popular franchises. [95]  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic , from March to May 2020, Marvel and its distributor Diamond Comic Distributors stopped producing and releasing new comic books. [96] [97] [98]  On March 25, 2021, Marvel Comics announced they plan to shift their direct market distribution for monthly comics and graphic novels from Diamond Comic Distributors to Penguin Random House . The change is schedule to start on October 1, 2021 in a multi-year partnership. Marvel will still be giving stores the options to order comics from Diamond, but Diamond will be acting as a wholesaler rather than distributor. [1]   Officers [ edit ]  Michael Z.

This head editor\\'s title later became \"editor-in-chief\". Joe Simon was the company\\'s first true chief-editor, with publisher Martin Goodman , who had served as titular editor only and outsourced editorial operations. In 1994 Marvel briefly abolished the position of editor-in-chief, replacing Tom DeFalco with five group editors-in-chief. As Carl Potts described the 1990s editorial arrangement:  In the early \\'90s, Marvel had so many titles that there were three Executive Editors, each overseeing approximately 1/3 of the line. Bob Budiansky was the third Executive Editor [following the previously appointed Mark Gruenwald and Potts]. We all answered to Editor-in-Chief Tom DeFalco and Publisher Mike Hobson . All three Executive Editors decided not to add our names to the already crowded credits on the Marvel titles. Therefore it wasn\\'t easy for readers to tell which titles were produced by which Executive Editor … In late \\'94, Marvel reorganized into a number of different publishing divisions, each with its own Editor-in-Chief. [104]  Marvel reinstated the overall editor-in-chief position in 1995 with Bob Harras .

The title of associate editor later was revived under the editor-in-chief as an editorial position in charge of few titles under the direction of an editor and without an assistant editor.

Various publishers took up the licenses from 1978 to 2002. Also, with the various licensed films being released beginning in 1997, various publishers put out movie novelizations . [120] In 2003, following publication of the prose young adult novel  Mary Jane , starring Mary Jane Watson from the Spider-Man mythos, Marvel announced the formation of the publishing imprint  Marvel Press . [121] However, Marvel moved back to licensing with Pocket Books from 2005 to 2008. [120] With few books issued under the imprint, Marvel and Disney Books Group relaunched Marvel Press in 2011 with the Marvel Origin Storybooks line. [122]   Television programs [ edit ]  Main article: List of television series based on Marvel Comics  Many television series, both live-action and animated, have based their productions on Marvel Comics characters. These include series for popular characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk, the Avengers, the X-Men, Fantastic Four, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, the Punisher, the Defenders, S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter, Deadpool, Legion, and others. Additionally, a handful of television movies, usually also pilots, based on Marvel Comics characters have been made.  Theme parks [ edit ]  Marvel has licensed its characters for theme parks and attractions, including Marvel Super Hero Island at Universal Orlando \\'s Islands of Adventure [123] in Orlando, Florida , which includes rides based on their iconic characters and costumed performers, as well as The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man ride cloned from Islands of Adventure to Universal Studios Japan . [124]  Years after Disney purchased Marvel in late 2009, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts plans on creating original Marvel attractions at their theme parks, [125] [126] with Hong Kong Disneyland becoming the first Disney theme park to feature a Marvel attraction . [127] [128] Due to the licensing agreement with Universal Studios, signed prior to Disney\\'s purchase of Marvel, Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disney Resort are barred from having Marvel characters in their parks. [129] However, this only includes characters that Universal is currently using, other characters in their \"families\" (X-Men, Avengers, Fantastic Four, etc.), and the villains associated with said characters. [123] This clause has allowed Walt Disney World to have meet and greets, merchandise, attractions and more with other Marvel characters not associated with the characters at Islands of Adventures, such as Star-Lord and Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy .

I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC\\'s 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and [production chief] Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us … who worked for DC during our college summers.... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC owned Independent News). … As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. … Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces. … Sol worked closely with Independent News\\' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse\\'s mouth.  Goodman, a publishing trend-follower aware of the JLA\\'s strong sales, confirmably directed his comics editor, Stan Lee , to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee in Origins of Marvel Comics ( Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books , 1974), p. 16:\\n\"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called The [ sic ] Justice League of America and it was composed of a team of superheroes. … \\' If the Justice League is selling \\', spoke he, \\'why don\\'t we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?\\'\"    References [ edit ]    ^ a  b  .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit} Schedeen, Jesse (March 25, 2021). \"Marvel Comics Shifts to New Distributor in Industry-Rattling Move - IGN\" .

Her death has haunted Peter ever since, and stories published long afterwards indicate she still holds a special place in his heart. The character has been portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard in the 2007 film Spider-Man 3 and by Emma Stone in the 2012 reboot film The Amazing Spider-Man and its sequel The Amazing Spider-Man 2 .

You can help by adding to it .  ( July 2013 )  Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko , Gwen Stacy first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #31 (December 1965). [2] Stan Lee states that his wife, Joan , was the inspiration for Gwen. [3]   Fictional character biography [ edit ]  Early history [ edit ]  In her initial appearances, Peter Parker met Gwen while both were studying as undergraduates at Empire State University , [4] but with Aunt May in the hospital, Peter was troubled and ignored her advances. She dated both Flash Thompson and Harry Osborn to make Peter jealous. Gradually, however, a romance developed; Gwen, a science major, appreciated Peter\\'s intellect. Their relationship began almost immediately after Peter stopped going out with Mary Jane Watson , whom he began to see as shallow and self-absorbed. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Later issues introduced Gwen\\'s father, NYPD Captain George Stacy . Though her father was both fond of Peter and supportive of his alter-ego Spider-Man, his death strained Peter\\'s relationship with Gwen after he was killed by falling debris during a battle involving Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus . [5] [6] Gwen blamed Spider-Man for his death, and left for Europe to cope with her loss. She wanted Peter to ask her to marry him and convince her to stay, but his guilt stopped him from proposing. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] Gwen\\'s feelings for Peter eventually prompted her to return to New York, and their relationship was rekindled. [7]  According to Lee, who scripted all of the stories featuring Gwen Stacy up to this point, the original intent was for Gwen Stacy to be Spider-Man\\'s central love interest. However, Mary Jane Watson \\'s unexpected popularity with readers after her debut changed the course of the plan as fans liked Mary Jane more and demanded for her to be Peter Parker\\'s main love interest instead, and that \"no matter how we [i.e. Lee and his artist/co-plotter collaborators] wrote it, Mary Jane always seemed more interesting!\" [8] [9]   Death [ edit ]  Main article: The Night Gwen Stacy Died  Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas succeeded Stan Lee as writer and editor, respectively, of The Amazing Spider-Man . Together with inker John Romita, Sr. , they came to the decision to have Gwen Stacy killed off. [10] It was Romita who first suggested the idea, during a plotting session with Conway when Romita was still penciller on The Amazing Spider-Man . [11] Conway later said his contribution to the decision was motivated by a desire to bring Mary Jane Watson to the forefront, [11] [12] as he shared Lee\\'s feeling that she was a more interesting character than Gwen Stacy: \"[Mary Jane] hadn\\'t lost the edge that made her an interesting character. Gwen didn\\'t have an edge. She was just a nice person\". [13]  In The Amazing Spider-Man #121 (June 1973), the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen Stacy and throws her off a bridge (depicted as the Brooklyn Bridge but described in the text as the George Washington Bridge ). [14] [15] Spider-Man shoots a web strand at Gwen\\'s legs and catches her, but her neck is broken by the whiplash from her sudden stop. [14]  Both the decision to kill Gwen and the method in which Marvel implemented it remain controversial among fans because some believe that Peter himself was the one who caused her death. The death became a pivotal point in both Spider-Man\\'s history and in American comic books in general. Many point to Gwen\\'s death as the end of the Silver Age of Comics . [16] Before her death, except possibly as part of an origin story, superheroes did not fail so catastrophically, nor did the hero\\'s loved ones die so suddenly and without warning. [17] [18] [19]  A note on the letters page of The Amazing Spider-Man #125 states: \"It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey\\'s webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her\". [14] The comic book Civil War: Casualties of War: Captain America/Iron Man (2007) concurred that the proximate cause of death was the sudden stop during a high-speed fall. An issue of Peter Parker/Spider-Man revisits the issue, and further confirms Gwen died of a broken neck due to the use of the webbing. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] On the other hand, in the 1987 edition of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe , Gwen\\'s death is attributed to the fall, not to Spider-Man\\'s webbing, though the listed cause of death is still technically true - if she hadn\\'t fallen from the bridge, the event that caused her death couldn\\'t have happened. In his book The Physics of Superheroes , physicist James Kakalios confirms that, consistent with Newton\\'s laws of motion , the sudden stop would have killed Gwen Stacy. [20]  Within the Marvel Comics , Gwen Stacy\\'s death has enormous repercussions. Mary Jane Watson feels the loss of Gwen deeply and becomes a more mature, compassionate person. Gwen\\'s death also draws Peter and Mary Jane into a closer friendship, and eventually to romance. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] Miles Warren, one of Gwen\\'s professors, was secretly in love with her. Following her death, Warren goes insane and adopts the persona of the Jackal . [21] In the fourth and final issue of the miniseries Marvels (April 1994), photographer Phil Sheldon befriends Gwen Stacy, who has absolved Spider-Man of any blame for her father\\'s death. Gwen\\'s simple faith in heroes convinces Sheldon of the purpose of the \"Marvels\" (i.e., superheroes)—to protect innocents such as Gwen. He resolves to write a book to praise the heroes and what they should mean to humanity. When the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen and holds her hostage to bait Spider-Man, Sheldon frantically follows the resulting chase in a taxi and witnesses her death. While it is reported that she died from the shock of the fall, Sheldon thinks it looks like something else. Sheldon\\'s faith in the Marvels is shattered. [22]   Clones [ edit ]  Following the publication of The Amazing Spider-Man #121, Stan Lee (who had since become Marvel\\'s publisher) was frequently criticized by fans during his public appearances for killing off Gwen Stacy. [12] Lee, who had also found the character\\'s death objectionable, [10] insisted that Conway write a story bringing her back. [12] Conway strongly objected since he felt any sort of resurrection would break the plausibility of the stories, but ultimately gave in under the condition that after reviving Gwen, he could write her out of the book as soon as he wanted. [13] He decided that cloning would be the best means to bring the character back. In the resulting story, set approximately two years after Gwen Stacy\\'s death, [23] \"Gwen\" reappears, perfectly healthy but with no memory of the time since her death. This story, published in Amazing Spider-Man #144 (May 1975), initiated the original Clone Saga . At the end of that story, Gwen\\'s clone, a creation of Spider-Man villain the Jackal , leaves to find a new life for herself, coming to accept that she is not really the same person who had a relationship with Peter Parker. [24]  In the 1988 crossover \" The Evolutionary War \", the High Evolutionary , who had once been Miles Warren\\'s teacher, captures Gwen\\'s clone. He determines that Warren had actually not perfected the process, and instead injected a young woman with a genetic virus carrying Gwen\\'s DNA, turning her into a copy of Gwen. After a subsequent altercation of Spider-Man and the Young Gods against the High Evolutionary\\'s Purifiers, this woman is purged of the virus by the Young Goddess Daydreamer. [25] This is later retconned , with the High Evolutionary stating that Warren had in fact succeeded in perfecting his own cloning technique, and Daydreamer had accidentally given the Gwen clone a false new life under the name of Joyce Delaney. [26]  During the second \" Clone Saga \", Joyce, now married to a clone of Professor Warren named Warren Miles, sees a copy of Peter Parker\\'s book of Spider-Man photos, Webs , and remembers (to an extent) her real history. She returns to New York City, but after helping Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider fight the Jackal, she again disappears from Spider-Man\\'s life. [27] She makes herself a new life in London, but is murdered years later by the Gwen Stacy clone known as Abby-L. [28]  Another Gwen clone appears in The Amazing Spider-Man #399 (March 1995). This clone believes she is the real Gwen. She dies from clone degeneration in Spider-Man #56 (March 1995), the next issue of the story arc. A further Gwen clone appears in the \"Sibling Rivalry\" crossover storyline between Superior Spider-Man Team-Up and Scarlet Spider . She joins the Jackal (alongside Carrion and a regular Miles Warren clone) in capturing Superior Spider-Man and Kaine . [29] She is sympathetic towards \"Peter\" and Kaine, but at the same time utterly loyal to the Jackal. When the Spiders break free, Superior Spider-Man disarms and attempts to kill her, but is stopped by Kaine. When the Jackal\\'s lab is engulfed in flames, Kaine offers to save her, but she refuses, and is seemingly consumed by the fire. [30]   Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy [ edit ]  In the Clone Conspiracy storyline, a flashback revealed that Gwen Stacy was conscious during Spider-Man and Green Goblin\\'s battle on the bridge, and as she was falling to her death. She overheard their conversation and discovered Peter is Spider-Man in the process. She was angry at Peter for keeping this secret and for his involvement in her father\\'s death. [31]  In the present, Gwen is supposedly revived by the Jackal with his clones. The Jackal claims that this one is not a clone but the real Gwen who was harvested and reanimated from her remains and still has all her memories, including those of her death. The Jackal offers Gwen the opportunity to be his business partner as he tries to change the world with his new technology. Gwen is hesitant about this new life at first but accepts it when the Jackal shows that he has reanimated the clone of her father, who is in much better health than he was before he died. [31] When Spider-Man arrives at the incorporation and discovers the Jackal\\'s experiments, he is surprised by Gwen\\'s presence and notes that unlike the other people the Jackal revived, who were all clones, Gwen does not trigger his spider sense, making him wonder if she was the real one. He is attacked by the \"reborn\" Doctor Octopus before he can question the issue further. [31]  After the Jackal breaks up the fight and shows Spider-Man around the New U, the George Stacy clone recognizes something off about Gwen\\'s face and points his gun at her. It is revealed that the Gwen clone was actually her Earth-65 counterpart Spider-Woman who assists Spider-Man in escaping. The real Gwen is kidnapped by Kaine and taken to Parker Industries to be studied. Kaine reveals that he and Spider-Woman came to this Earth to assist Spider-Man because they saw that Spider-Man agreeing with the Jackal\\'s offer on other worlds always results in a global disaster. [32] Rhino and Electro are sent to retrieve Gwen after attacking the staff, but Gwen tells them to take Kaine with him too because his condition could help with Jackal\\'s experiments. Anna Maria Marconi also volunteers to come with because she has studied both Kaine and the drug. [33]  When Spider-Man is taken to Haven, he catches up with Gwen in the household in the facility, where she tries to convince him to support New U Technologies. Peter still has a hard time believing she is the real Gwen given his other experiences with clones. Gwen tries justifying her existence by telling Peter her memories, including how she overheard the Green Goblin talking to Spider-Man before her death. Peter thinks she died hating him, but Gwen said that she did not hate him, but rather died feeling betrayed. Peter again still has doubts towards Gwen not being a clone. She tries kissing him, to no avail which only pushes him to put the mask back on. Gwen witnesses Jackal order the cloned villains to kill Spider-Man and decides to help Peter. [34]  Doctor Octopus pulls a switch that activates the Carrion Virus in all of the revived, including Gwen and George, and causes them to start rapidly decaying. [35] After Gwen\\'s father deteriorates in her arms, she assists Spider-Man by helping him get to the lab. When the cloned villains get to the lab doors, Gwen locks Spider-Man inside the lab and sacrifices herself to give him more time. Following the Carrion Virus being thwarted, Spider-Man and Anna check the building and see that Gwen has been reduced to dust. [36]  During the \" Last Remains \" storyline, Kindred later visited the cemetery where Gwen Stacy and George Stacy were buried. He exhumed their bodies and placed them around the table at his hideout while awaiting for Spider-Man to find him. [37] When Spider-Man finally confronts Kindred, Gwen and George\\'s corpses were sat around a dinner table alongside the exhumed bodies of Ben Parker , Flash Thompson , J. Jonah Jameson Sr., Jean DeWolff , and Marla Jameson. [38]   Other versions [ edit ]  \"Age of Apocalypse\" [ edit ]  In the two-issue mini-series X-Universe , which details what happened to the rest of the Marvel Universe during the \" Age of Apocalypse \" storyline, the Green Goblin never killed Gwen Stacy. Instead she became the bodyguard of Donald Blake, who, in this reality, had never become the Mighty Thor . Sometime later in the mainstream universe in X-Man #37, the Age of Apocalypse version of Gwen is pulled from her reality to the mainstream Earth\\'s George Washington Bridge, much to Spider-Man\\'s shock. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   \"House of M\" [ edit ]  In the reality seen in the \" House of M \" storyline, in which the Scarlet Witch alters reality to make mutants the ruling class over humans, Gwen was never killed. Instead, she married Peter Parker, and the couple had a young son. She had become a scientist, a savvy businesswoman, and a peace activist – and had a decidedly hostile relationship with chemical weapon developer Norman Osborn . Mary Jane Watson, a popular actress in this reality, played Gwen Stacy in the film adaptation of Spider-Man\\'s life story. Gwen and her father read textual accounts of their deaths in the main universe, though they believe this simply to be the morbid imaginings of Peter Parker, who is suffering from mental health issues. [39]   Marvel Adventures [ edit ]  Gwen Stacy first appeared in Marvel Adventures Spider-Man #53 as a new student of Midtown High. She had transferred from her previous school after the Torino Gang, a powerful New York mob, began harassing her in an attempt to keep her father, police captain George Stacy, from arresting members of their gang. However, the Torinos continued to harass Gwen at Midtown, prompting Spider-Man to help the police take down the gang. [40] Like her father, Gwen believes Spider-Man is a hero. She subsequently began participating in a \"Spider-Man Appreciation Society\" designed to foster better public opinion of Spider-Man. [41] Gwen is also attracted to Spider-Man\\'s alter ego Peter Parker; although she openly flirted with him, Peter began dating a different girl, Sophia \"Chat\" Sanduval , which made Gwen very unhappy. [42] Later, Gwen was brainwashed by Emma Frost into believing she was dating Peter. Gwen\\'s brainwashing wore off (or was undone by Emma), but Gwen now believes her relationship with Peter ended when he chose Chat over her, [43] causing her to treat Chat very coldly. She has since warmed to Chat, however. [44] Recently, Gwen began a close friendship with Carter Torino who is the grandson of the head of the Torino Gang. [41] Their relationship is complicated by the fact Gwen\\'s father is still trying to take down Carter\\'s criminal family. [45]   Marvel Zombies Return [ edit ]  In the limited series, Marvel Zombies Return , Gwen of \\'Earth Z\\' is still a college student out with her friends Mary Jane and Harry Osborn. The zombified Spider-Man travels to this earth and, despite his best intentions, turns the Sinister Six . They then slay and partly consume Gwen and her friends. To stop the spread of the virus, Spider-Man obliterates the bodies. [46]   Powerless [ edit ]  In the Powerless mini-series, Gwen Stacy again appears as the girlfriend of Peter Parker. Norman Osborn again kidnaps and attempts to kill her as a part of a plan to intimidate Peter. In a twist, the powerless Peter (with a limb crippled from a spider bite) manages to save Gwen from falling to her death. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Spider-Gwen [ edit ]   Gwen Stacy as Spider-Woman on the textless cover of Spider-Gwen #0 (November 2015). Art by Robbi Rodriguez.  Main article: Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)  In the alternate reality designated Earth-65, Gwen Stacy is the one bitten by the radioactive spider, and becomes a superhero going by the name of Spider-Woman . She is also a member of a band fronted by Mary Jane Watson, simply called the Mary Janes. Shortly after Gwen begins fighting crime, Peter Parker, her best friend attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him, becoming this universe\\'s version of the Lizard . Gwen subdues him, but Peter dies towards the end of the battle due to the chemical he used. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an outcry for her arrest, led by J. Jonah Jameson . Her father, who is also a police chief in this world, begins a hunt for her. This follows Gwen into college, where she is still a member of the Mary Janes. At a gig of theirs, an assassin is sent after Gwen\\'s father, who is in the audience. Gwen defeats the assassin, the audience and band clearing out during the battle. While they are alone, Captain Stacy holds Spider-Woman at gun point, with Gwen taking off her mask to reveal who she is. Shocked upon learning Spider-Woman\\'s identity, he tells her to run before he changes his mind. In the distance, the Captain Britain from Earth-833, called Spider-UK, is watching, saying that Gwen will \"do quite nicely\". [47]  Gwen is recruited by Spider-UK to team up with other Spider-Totems across the multiverse, and next appears on Earth-616 with Old Man Spider-Man of Earth-4 and Spider-Man of Earth-70105 (who in that reality is Bruce Banner ) to rescue Kaine , who was under attack by the Inheritors . [48] Marvel-616 Peter is hesitant to put Gwen in action and she is told by the others of how he failed to save her in his world. However he does recruit her for a mission and they both agree to look out for each other. [49] Gwen is sent to recruit an alternate version of Peter Parker who is driven insane after he failed to save the Gwen Stacy in his dimension, killed the Green Goblin, and became the Hobgoblin . She tells him that he can become the man he once was if he joins them, but they are attacked by the Inheritors. Hobgoblin sacrifices himself to save Gwen. [50]  After the events of Spider-Verse , Gwen returns to her home of Earth-65 where she continues her career as Spider-Woman in her own solo series, Spider-Gwen . She first saves George Stacy from mercenary Aleksei Sytsevich who was sent by Wilson Fisk and his lawyer Matt Murdock to target him. [51] Then she begins a hunt for the Vulture who has been terrorizing the city in her absence. [52]  She appears as one of the main characters in the Secret Wars  Spider-Verse event with Spider-Ham , Spider-Girl , Spider-UK , Spider-Man Noir , and Spider-Man India in a Battleworld called Archania ruled by Norman Osborn. They eventually form a team called the Web Warriors where they help other Spider-Men and Women in various dimensions. A child version of her also appears in Giant Size Little Marvel Avengers vs X-Men as a new kid that Tony Stark tries to ask out on a date. She rejects him because he\\'s a kid with a goatee and mustache. Another version of her is a member of Arcadia\\'s\\'s A-Force . On Earth-8, she is married to Miles Morales and they have two children with Spider Powers. [53]   Spider-Punk [ edit ]  In an issue of Web Warriors, Spider-Punk mentions that the Gwen Stacy in his dimension was a musical icon. [54]   Spider-Man: Fairy Tales [ edit ]  Issue #1 of Spider-Man: Fairy Tales follows the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood , reimagined with Mary Jane Watson as the titular character. Gwen Stacy has been previously killed by the wolf. Issue #4 is an adaption of Cinderella with Gwen as Princess Gwendolyn. She falls in love with the masked \"Prince of Arachne\" who is revealed to be Peter Parker, servant to Sir Osborn , but is killed during a fight between Osborn and Parker. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane [ edit ]  Gwen Stacy first appears at the end of Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane #5. She is the new girl at school and quickly becomes close friends with Peter Parker. In Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane #9, Peter and Gwen take their relationship to the next level by sharing a tender kiss, much to the dismay of Mary Jane . They date for a time, though Gwen breaks up with Peter when she learns Mary Jane is the girl he claims he truly loves. MJ, attempting to fix this, breaks up with Peter and reunites with Harry. [55]   Spider-Man: Life Story [ edit ]  Spider-Man: Life Story features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Gwen discovers that Peter is Spider-Man when she sees his costume underneath Peter\\'s shirt at the train station shortly after Flash was deployed to Vietnam. She eventually marries Peter and becomes Chief Biologist for Miles Warren\\'s bio-engineering company. In 1977, Harry Osborn\\'s attack on Warren\\'s company as the Black Goblin revealed that Miles created clones of Norman Osborn, Peter, and Gwen. Harry blows up the containment tubes containing the clones which kills all of them except for Peter\\'s clone. However, Miles reveals that the \"Gwen\" Peter was with was actually her clone; he abducted the real Gwen with the intention of attempting to win her over later, with the result that the real Gwen died in the explosion. A year later, Peter and Gwen\\'s clones rename themselves as Ben and Helen Parker and move out of New York for a second chance at life, the clone\\'s relationship with the original Peter apparently not surviving the revelation of her clone status. [56] She apparently died at some point before the 1990s, at which point Peter\\'s clone Ben was convinced that he was the original and Peter allowed him to take over so that he could \\'retire\\' as Spider-Man. [57]   Spider-Man Unlimited [ edit ]  In the fourth issue of the comic book based on the Spider-Man Unlimited animated series, Spidey encounters a Counter-Earth version of Gwen Stacy.

[58]   Ultimate Marvel [ edit ]  In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Gwen Stacy first appears in Ultimate Spider-Man #14 (December 2001) as a teenage girl at Peter\\'s high school. In this continuity, Gwen, whose rendition by artist Mark Bagley was inspired by an early-career Madonna , [59] has amber eyes, wears punk-style clothing, and harbors a rebellious personality. [60] In her first appearance she gives a rousing speech on \\'super powers\\'; in the next issue she pulls a knife on Kong , a classmate who was bullying Peter . She is suspended from school temporarily. Gwen becomes friends with Peter, which leads Mary Jane Watson to believe Gwen is vying for his affections. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Gwen is later taken in by Aunt May after her father, police captain John Stacy, is killed by a burglar wearing a Spider-Man costume and her estranged mother does not want to take her in. Her living in the Parker house creates more tension between Peter and Mary Jane, and leads to their temporary break-up. Peter\\'s relationship with Gwen is further complicated by her hatred of Spider-Man, whom she blames for her father\\'s death. When Peter finds his friend Eddie Brock , Gwen confides in him about her feelings of isolation. Eddie then tries to kiss her and Gwen is shocked. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] When she eventually learns Peter is Spider-Man, the angry Gwen pulls her father\\'s gun on him. He manages to convince her he is not to blame for her father\\'s death. Gwen runs off but returns, explaining she is just really mad at everything at the moment. She wouldn\\'t have really shot him, a fact Peter already knew because his spider sense didn\\'t go off despite Gwen\\'s wrath. Gwen then agrees to keep his secret. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Gwen Stacy dies in Ultimate Spider-Man #62. Before her death, she made peace with Mary Jane and assured her she never had romantic feelings for Peter. She considered him just as a friend. She is killed by Carnage , a vampiric monster made by the splicing of genetic material from Peter Parker, his father, and Dr. Curt Connors . Although Peter is not in the area when she dies, he still feels some responsibility for her death, as he allowed Dr. Connors to use his genetic material for experimentation. His guilt makes him decide to retire as Spider-Man for a while. Eventually, he takes up his hero identity when his responsibility for the innocent becomes too great to overlook. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] At the end of the arc, there was an issue that dealt with Gwen\\'s death. Flash Thompson makes an off-color remark about Gwen\\'s passing. It infuriates MJ to the point where she physically attacks Flash. It is revealed Flash had a crush on Gwen all along. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  A girl seeming to be Gwen Stacy appears in Ultimate Spider-Man #98 . Says Ultimate artist  Mark Bagley , \"Gwen’s return is integral to the Clone storyline and is basically a way to rock Peter\\'s world...again\". [ dead link ] [61] In this issue \"Gwen\" appears to have no memory of her \"death\" and believes she was in a hospital, from which she has escaped. In issue #100, after a raft of revelations, the stress of the situation enrages \"Gwen\". She transforms into what appears to be Carnage before leaping out the window. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] In the next issue, \" Richard Parker \" claims \"Gwen\" should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in stem cell research . This Gwen/Carnage fights with the Fantastic Four, Nick Fury, and the Spider-Slayer drones, until she is knocked unconscious by a beam of light, and taken into custody. In issue #113, Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin causes a massive prison break from the Triskelion. An inmate appearing to be \\'Gwen\\' walks out amidst the chaos, disappearing in the shadows. It has been revealed the creature posing as Gwen Stacy is still the original Ultimate Carnage Spider-Man faced earlier in its run. After \"devouring\" Gwen, this incarnation of Carnage has gone on to mimic her \"essence\" and now believes itself to be Gwen Stacy. [ dead link ] [62]  During the \"War of the Symbiotes\" storyline, Gwen/Carnage\\'s back story in the Triskelion is revealed. It is shown Gwen has been taking some form of therapy with Tony Stark. However, when the Green Goblin broke out of the Triskelion, Gwen escaped and went to Peter Parker\\'s house in a confused and terrified state, with Carnage\\'s face on her body. During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake his symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Venom on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie but Eddie reabsorbs his symbiote along with the Carnage symbiote rendering Gwen Stacy an average girl. After a series of tests, it is concluded that this Gwen is not a clone but consciously and genetically is the genuine article now reborn (though Gwen\\'s original body died, the Carnage symbiote absorbed her being and they had bonded since her death). After S.H.I.E.L.D. intervenes, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Danvers states Gwen will remain in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Peter and May argue for her to come back to live with them, with Tony Stark supporting the Parkers. In Ultimate Spider-Man #129, the Parkers are now helping to rebuild Gwen\\'s life. Her ghastly experience with the Carnage symbiote also causes her to develop a death anxiety she gradually controls. Six months after the \"Ultimatum\" storyline, in Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #1, Gwen is living with the Parkers again and seems to be dating Peter. However, circumstances involving the Chameleon made Gwen realize she made a mistake dating Peter. She breaks up with him, but still lives with the Parkers due to Gwen and Aunt May has become close in a surrogate mother-daughter fashion. After Peter\\'s death, Gwen and May re-located in France , but returned to New York after hearing about the re-emergence of a new Spider-Man , Miles Morales. [63] [64]  During the \" Spider-Men \" storyline, Gwen and Aunt May meet the Peter Parker of the Earth-616 continuity after he was accidentally and briefly sent to the Ultimate universe, [65] with Gwen being intrigued to learn about her counterpart (although she is not informed that her other self dead, Gwen also did not tell Peter that she had died and revived), as she also attempts to tell Mary Jane about the other Peter\\'s arrival in their world. [66]  When Green Goblin escapes custody after S.H.I.E.L.D. was shut down, he arrives at the front yard of Aunt May\\'s house and confronts Miles. [67] Gwen and Aunt May are inside watching the television where the battle of Miles and Green Goblin was being broadcast. Soon, Peter emerges to aid Miles in the fight, to the surprise of Gwen and Aunt May. Green Goblin flees at his arrival and the two Spider-Men depart. Gwen is unsure of the identity of the original Spider-Man, however, Aunt May assures her that his motives show that it him. [68] Later, Gwen and Aunt May walk over to Mary Jane\\'s house and overhear Peter\\'s unknown resurrection. Gwen sprints over and joyfully reunites with him. [69] After the two Spider-Men defeat Green Goblin, Peter tells Gwen that he intends to go on a quest to find out the truth of his mystery resurrection. [70]  Early in the series, Ultimate Spider-Man #25 (October 2002) paid homage to Gwen Stacy\\'s death in the Earth-616 continuity, although Gwen herself was not involved. The Green Goblin tossed Mary Jane off the Queensboro Bridge . Spider-Man caught her leg with his webbing, just as with Gwen. The issue ended with a cliffhanger: when Spider-Man pulled Mary Jane up, she appeared to be either unconscious or dead. The cliffhanger was resolved in the next issue when Mary Jane awoke in #26, uninjured. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   What If [ edit ]  In \"What if Gwen Stacy had lived?\", Peter saves Gwen by jumping after her rather than catching her with a web-line. In doing this, he cushions her from the impact as they hit the water and subsequently gives her CPR. After regaining consciousness, Gwen sees him without his mask. After explaining himself to her, Peter proposes to Gwen, and she accepts. Meanwhile, the Green Goblin mails to J. Jonah Jameson proof of Spider-Man\\'s real identity. On the day of Peter\\'s wedding to Gwen, Jonah has published the expose and uses it to acquire a warrant for Peter\\'s arrest. Peter escapes from the police moments after his wedding to Gwen, but the issue ends with Peter on the run from the law and pondering his uncertain future. As the issue ends, Gwen departs with Joe \\'Robbie\\' Robertson , who promises Gwen they will do whatever they can to help Peter and quits the Bugle . [71]  In \"What If Spider-Man Had Kept His Six Arms?\", Spider-Man (whose six-arms mutation was permanent here) is able to prevent Gwen Stacy\\'s death. [72]  At the very end of Peter David \\'s one-shot \"What If: The Other\", Peter Parker (now calling himself \"Poison\") uses part of the Venom symbiote attached to him in the resurrection of Gwen Stacy. She takes the appearance of Carnage . [73]  In \"What if Peter Parker became the Punisher?\", Peter (who is the Punisher in this continuity) is able to save Gwen by killing the Green Goblin and webbing her body to a suspended scaffold on the bridge. Feeling guilty over almost getting her killed, he quits being the Punisher to be with her. [74]  Earth-617 [ edit ]  The Gwen Stacy of this reality had a similar history to the main iteration of the character, until she encountered a Gwen Stacy from an future alternate timeline. At first, thinking that this Gwen was a clone, she later learned that this Gwen was actually a superhero, but when trying to get more information, Spider-Gwen fled in a rage. She learned that Spider-Gwen\\'s father had been put in a coma, which caused her rage, then Gwen helped her counterpart to come to epiphany that she should treasure that she still has her father alive in contrast to her, whose father had died. After that, Gwen with the help of Tony Stark and Hank Pym of this reality, successfully send Spider-Gwen to her timeline. After this encounter, Gwen was inspired to become a detective and bonded to the Venom symbiote of her reality to become Spider-Woman . With the use of a Dimensional Travel Watch, she was able to travel across the multiverse and encountered other versions of herself; some of which who had also become Spider-Woman. With these Spider-Women, they formed the Council of Spider-Women and they avoided the Spider-Verse event. She then came across the Spider-Gwen from the past and sent her to her past timeline, creating a time-loop. She then terrorized the Uatus from Earth-65 and Earth-8, since they were fighting the children of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy. After that, she returned to her reality to fight crime. [75]   Secret Wars [ edit ]  In Secret Wars : Battleworld #3, a version of Gwen with the powers of Wolverine called Gwenverine , was brought along with the other Wolverines by Mojo , into fighting the pacifist Monk Wolverine. [76]   Spider-Geddon [ edit ]  During the return of the Inheritors , Spider-Gwen\\'s device to travel through the multiverse got destroyed by Verna and then Gwen got stranded in an alternate universe. [77] In this universe, Peter Parker and this universe\\'s Gwen Stacy got a job at Oscorp and Peter wanted to create a cure for cancer after his Uncle Ben died from it. Peter was experimenting with spider venom to create the cure, but one of the spiders bit Harry Osborn making Harry this universe\\'s Spider-Man. Harry alongside Gwen Stacy as this universe\\'s Green Goblin started to fight crime together where they even took down Vulture. This lasted until a fight with the Sandman where both Harry and George Stacy got killed. The accident did something to the circuitry that enabled Gwen to control the Goblin Glider that left her mostly acting like the Green Goblin with no memory of being Gwen Stacy. Spider-Gwen is eventually able to free her counterpart from her insanity. To thank her, the Goblin Gwen fixes Spider-Gwen\\'s multiversal travel device to allow her to return to her allies.

An alternate version of the character did appear in the series finale, voiced by Mary Kay Bergman . She is the fiancée of Spider-Man\\'s high-tech armored counterpart in a parallel universe, and the primary version of Spider-Man meets Gwen for the first time. Gwen plays a role in helping to defeat Spider-Carnage .  Gwen Stacy appears as a central character in The Spectacular Spider-Man , voiced by Lacey Chabert . Depicted as a teenager, this version is friends with Peter Parker and Harry Osborn and is the daughter of George Stacy . She has hidden romantic feelings for Peter, being hurt several times when he expressed interest in other girls. Throughout season one, she becomes concerned when Harry become addicted to Gobulin Green. She kisses Peter, leaving them in an awkward standing in season two. Despite their feelings for each other, Peter begins dating Liz Allan and she dates Harry. In the series finale, she and Peter acknowledge how they feel about each other, and agree to break up with Harry and Liz. But after Norman Osborn \\'s apparent death, Gwen stays in a relationship with Harry because she would be the only one to care for Harry.  Gwen Stacy appears in Ultimate Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six , voiced by Dove Cameron . This version, native to Miles Morales \\'s dimension and a friend of the late Peter Parker , doesn\\'t have Spider powers and instead relies on tech stolen from her father\\'s robot program to be Spider-Woman with the help of May Parker after Miles gets transported to Peter Parker\\'s alternate dimension. In \"Return to the Spider-Verse\" [Pt. 4], she aids Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid in the final battle against Wolf-Spider.  Gwen Stacy appears in the 2017 Spider-Man animated series, [79] voiced by Laura Bailey . [80] This version is one of Peter Parker\\'s classmates at Horizon High and specializes in DNA formulas. She was inspired to pursue science by her maternal uncle Raymond Warren who is later revealed to be the villainous Jackal . In the \"Spider Island\" event, she becomes Spider-Gwen after being exposed to the Jackal\\'s chemicals and assists Spider-Man as a hero, but is later mutated into a giant spider as the experiment starts affecting the rest of New York (similar to Carlie Cooper \\'s role in the original story). She is later cured in the climax of the story. In \"The Day Without Spider-Man\", she regains her powers thanks to exposure to a crystal called the Bloodgem and becomes Ghost-Spider during the fight against Scorpion and Tinkerer. In \"Vengeance Of Venom\" Pt. 2, Ghost-Spider is among the heroes captured by the Klyntar during their invasion of Earth before been saved. In \"Spider-Man Unmasked\" Pt. 2, Gwen finally learns Spider-Man\\'s secret identity and eventually forgives him for keeping it a secret from her.  Film [ edit ]  Sam Raimi series [ edit ]  A student in Peter Parker\\'s university class in Spider-Man 2 , portrayed by an uncredited extra , is identified as Gwen Stacy in the film\\'s novelization.  Gwen Stacy is portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard in Spider-Man 3 . In this film\\'s version, she is Eddie ’s one-time love interest before Peter Parker \\'s, serving as an unintended rival to Mary Jane Watson . Gwen is a classmate and lab partner of Peter. Spider-Man rescues her early in the film from a construction crane accident during her modeling shoot. She later kisses an upside-down Spider-Man in a public ceremony similar fashion to how Mary Jane did in the first film which causes Mary Jane to become angry and hurt. As Peter is at the top of Dr. Connors \\'s quantum mechanics class, he tutors Gwen, who considers Peter a genius and is very fond of him. Gwen was also friends with Eddie since he took pictures of her so she could be a model. They went on a single date before Peter, under the influence of the symbiote, steals Gwen from Eddie. He dances with her at the same jazz club where Mary Jane works, but Gwen realizes Peter is doing this to make Mary Jane jealous. Upset about this, Gwen apologizes to Mary Jane and storms out of the club, leaving Peter behind. She is later present at Harry Osborn \\'s funeral.  Bryce Dallas Howard said she would love to be a part of any continuation of the film franchise, while acknowledging her character\\'s opportunity may have passed, especially after Spider-Man 3 ended with Peter and Mary Jane once again in each other\\'s arms. In May 2007, actor James Cromwell , who played Captain Stacy in the film stated he thought the natural progression for the character would be for both to die early in Spider-Man 4 , mirroring the comics. Howard said a death would not have bothered her. The film was ultimately unmade, although Stacy was in the draft.  Marc Webb series [ edit ]  Main article: Gwen Stacy (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)  Emma Stone portrays Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man and its sequel The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as Peter Parker\\'s love interest and classmate, and also serves as a foil for his character. She works as an assistant at Dr. Curt Connors\\'s laboratory at Oscorp , where Peter is bitten by a genetically-engineered spider. The two fall in love during the first film, and the second film depicts their on-and-off relationship. A major change in Gwen\\'s character is that she first learns Peter is Spider-Man instead of her father unlike in the comics where it was the other way around and she is killed by Harry Osborn who assumes the Green Goblin persona instead of Norman. As viral marketing for the film, a Tumblr page was created for the character. [81]  In an interview with Screen Rant , Stone expressed interest in returning as a resurrected Stacy in a future The Amazing Spider-Man film, despite the character\\'s death at the end of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 . [82] By July 2014, development of follow-ups Sinister Six , The Amazing Spider-Man 3 , and The Amazing Spider-Man 4 had stalled; [83] [84] the films would have seen Stone reprise her role, the plot following a returned Norman Osborn setting a resurrected amnesiac Gwen as Carnage against Peter, Harry, and the Sinister Six. [85] [86] [87] By early 2015, a deal to reboot the series within the Marvel Cinematic Universe was reached, cancelling the franchise The Amazing Spider-Man . [88]  In both films, Kari Coleman, Charlie DePew, Skyler Gisondo and Jacob Rodier portray the Stacy family: Helen Stacy (Gwen\\'s mother), Philip Stacy, Howard Stacy, and Simon Stacy (Gwen\\'s younger brothers) respectively.  Other [ edit ]  Hailee Steinfeld voices an alternate reality version of the character known as Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy) in the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse .  Literature [ edit ]  Although she does not appear directly, Gwen\\'s death plays an important role in Revenge of the Sinister Six by Adam-Troy Castro , the second part of his Sinister Six trilogy, when Mysterio (posing as Electro ) takes hostages on the same bridge where Gwen died, using a holographic projection of Gwen\\'s death stuck on a loop to put Spider-Man at a psychological disadvantage. After Spider-Man drives Mysterio away, he takes a moment beside the hologram projector to mourn Gwen\\'s death.  Video games [ edit ]  Gwen Stacy is briefly mentioned in Spider-Man: Edge of Time . When a futuristic version of Peter Parker reveals plans to Spider-Man 2099 , Alchemex\\'s CEO mentions wanting to save the lives of Ben Parker , Gwen, George Stacy and countless others.  Gwen Stacy appears in The Amazing Spider-Man video game, voiced by Kari Wahlgren .  Gwen Stacy makes her debut as a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes , voiced again by Kari Wahlgren.  Gwen Stacy is playable once again in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 and can switch into her Spider-Gwen persona.  The Refrigerator Monologues [ edit ]  Gwen Stacy is recast as Paige Embry in The Refrigerator Monologues . She is the unofficial leader of the Hell Hath Club, a group of women in the afterlife trying to cope with the brutal termination of their plot lines, and provides connecting narration for each of their stories. She loved wearing her lab coat and feels unhappy about being stuck in the clothes she was buried in. Paige was a science intern with a nurse for a mother and a garbageman for a father. She snuck her boyfriend, Tom Thatcher, into her lab one night to show him an experimental form of \"hypermecury\" that she had helped design for the military. Despite Paige\\'s precautions, Tom was exposed to hypermercury and became Kid Mercury, a Spiderman/Flash parody. He started working as a superhero, and Paige destroyed almost all of the hypermercury to prevent unworthy people from gaining his powers. Their music theory teacher discovered their secret and tried to force Paige to give him the last remaining sample of hypermercury. Despite Tom and Paige\\'s efforts, he took the hypermercury and became Dr. Nocturne, a Lizard/Doctor Ocotpus parody. When Paige tried to take him down, he tossed her off a bridge, and her neck broke from an abrupt stop in Tom\\'s arms. She woke up in a garbage dump in Deadtown, but soon integrated herself into the community. The frozen nature of her ghostly existence means she cannot stop loving Tom, even though she knows that he has moved on. However, Paige has grown to enjoy her life in \"Deadtown,\" her name for the afterlife, although she is bitter about being sacrificed in the name of Kid Mercury\\'s character development. She lives in an apartment building with a slam-poetry-loving gargoyle on the balcony, and has Odysseus (whom she thinks is a dick) for an upstairs neighbor. At the end of the book, Samantha Dean (a version of Alexandra DeWitt ) moves into her building. [89]   Legacy [ edit ]  Due to the popularity of Spider-Gwen , in June 2015 Marvel published variant covers for 20 of their current series, which saw Gwen Stacy re-imagined as other Marvel characters, such as Doctor Strange , Groot and Wolverine . [90] One of those variants, for \"Deadpool\\'s Secret Secret Wars #2\", featured an amalgam of the design of Gwen Stacy and Wade Wilson dubbed \" Gwenpool \", which turned out to be especially popular with the fans. [91] As the result, Marvel produced two stories featuring Gwenpool as a character, a backup story in the series \" Howard the Duck \", and a one-shot \"Gwenpool Holiday Special #1\", [92] with Howard the Duck #1 establishing that her name is actually \" Gwen Poole \", not Gwen Stacy, or even an alternate version of either Gwen Stacy or Wade Wilson. Following the publication of the one-shot, an ongoing series titled The Unbelievable Gwenpool by the same creative team was announced, starting in April 2016.

He is a highly intelligent, myopic , and somewhat stocky mad scientist who sports four strong and durable appendages resembling an octopus \\'s tentacles, which extend from the back of his body and can be used for various purposes. After his mechanical harness became permanently fused to his body during a lab accident, Octavius turned to a life of crime, and came into conflict with the superhero  Spider-Man . Since his debut in The Amazing Spider-Man #3 (July 1963), Doctor Octopus has endured as one of Spider-Man\\'s most prominent villains, and is regarded as one of his three archenemies , alongside the Green Goblin and Venom . He is the founder and leader of the Sinister Six , the first supervillain team to oppose Spider-Man. While usually portrayed as a villain, Doctor Octopus has also been occasionally depicted as a conflicted antihero and ally of Spider-Man. Following Spider-Man\\'s death in the 2012 storyline \" Dying Wish \", which saw a dying Octavius swapping bodies with the hero and letting him die in his original body, Octavius became motivated to prove he can be a better Spider-Man. As such, he adopted the Superior Spider-Man alias, which was introduced in Avenging Spider-Man #15.1 following a cameo in Daredevil vol. 3 #21 (both December 2012). The Superior Spider-Man possesses all of the original Spider-Man\\'s abilities, memories, and equipment, along with additional gadgets created by Octavius, though he often struggles to live up to his predecessor\\'s legacy and turn his life around after being a villain for years. In 2013, Marvel launched a 45-issue The Superior Spider-Man comic book series focusing on the character\\'s redemption and superhero career. The original Spider-Man has since been resurrected and Octavius returned to his villainous ways, though a second volume of The Superior Spider-Man launched in 2018 saw the character briefly taking on the mantle once again. A fan favorite character and well-known figure in popular culture , Doctor Octopus has been featured in various media adaptations of Spider-Man over the years, including feature films , television series and video games . Alfred Molina portrayed the character in Spider-Man 2 (2004), who will reprise the role as a different incarnation in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Kathryn Hahn voiced a female version of Doctor Octopus in the 2018 animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse . Comics journalist and historian Mike Conroy writes of the character: \"Created by Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko , Doc Ock, as he became known, has become one of the web-slinger\\'s most persistent, enduring, and dangerous foes.\" [2] In 2014, IGN rated Doctor Octopus as Spider-Man\\'s greatest enemy.

[4] [5] [6] [7] Lee recounted: \"usually in creating a villain the first thing I would think of was a name, and then I would try to think of, \\'Well, now that I\\'ve got the name, who\\'s the character going to be and what will he do?\\' For some reason, I thought of an octopus. I thought, \\'I want to call somebody Octopus. And I want him to have a couple of extra arms just for fun\\'. But I had to figure out how to do that\". [8] The character soon re-appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #11-12 and then again in #31-33. Doctor Octopus is regarded as one of Spider-Man\\'s most infamous enemies. He has been cited as the man Peter might have become if he had not been raised with a sense of responsibility. [6] [9] [10] Doc Ock is infamous for defeating Spider-Man the first time in battle and for almost marrying Peter\\'s Aunt May . He is also the founder and core leader of the Sinister Six , and has also referred himself as the \"Master Planner\". (\" If This Be My Destiny...! \") [9] [11] Later depictions revealed him in Peter Parker\\'s body where he was the titular character from 2013 to 2014 . [10] In 2018, he returned as the Superior Spider-Man again in a series written by Christos Gage and illustrated by Mike Hawthorne. [12]   Fictional character biography [ edit ]  Born in Schenectady , New York , Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing. His father Torbert Octavius, a factory worker, was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother Mary Lavinia Octavius. The young Octavius\\'s shyness and good work in school got him labeled as a \"teacher\\'s pet\" and targeted as a subject for bullying. Torbert did not appreciate having a bullied son, and roared at him to use violence in dealing with the bullies. Mary Octavius would always defend her son from Torbert\\'s tirades , saying he was a gifted thinker who would use his brain to solve problems, not his fists. Due to his mother\\'s insistence and her disgust towards men who worked in common manual labor, Octavius was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. Octavius\\'s devotion to study paid off with him being awarded a university  scholarship . During Octavius\\'s freshman year of college, he was undecided in his studies until they were briefly interrupted by his father\\'s funeral; a construction accident having ended Torbert\\'s life. When Mary Octavius remarked that \"an early death is a manual laborer\\'s\" and she expected better from her son, this seemed to spur an obsession in Octavius about the hard sciences, and he declared his major to be physical science. His obsession, however, did not manifest immediately, and he was regarded by his school friends as a devoted student who was genuinely interested in the studies. He graduated near the top of his class, and was considered a catch to many scientific firms. Octavius was soon hired by an engineering firm. Octavius became a brilliant and respected nuclear physicist , atomic research consultant, inventor and lecturer . He designed a set of highly advanced mechanical arms controlled via a brain–computer interface to assist him with his research into atomic physics . The tentacle-like arms were resistant to radiation and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement, attached to a harness that fit around his body. [13] Later in his criminal career, he claimed the inspiration for the device came from the Vitruvian Man , the famous pencil sketch by Leonardo da Vinci , one of his idols. [14]  Though his relationship with co-workers was typically hostile, he was social enough to give a demonstration of his harness to a small group. He showed how the metal tentacles allowed him to work safely with chemicals that would normally be too dangerous for a human being to touch or be in close vicinity to. One such person impressed by this was a scientist named Mary Alice Anders, and the two soon dated. In due time, Otto proposed marriage to Mary Alice. However, when Otto joyously announced his future marriage to his mother, her feelings were not reciprocated. Believing that no woman was good enough for her son, she made him feel guilty that she was going to be pushed aside for his bride-to-be. Shocked that he hurt his mother, and to please her, Otto broke off the engagement with Mary Alice. Later, when he discovered that his mother had begun dating a librarian, he rebuked her, causing her to have a fatal heart attack in the heat of their argument. With the death of his mother and Mary Alice Anders out of his life, Octavius\\' disposition towards nearly everyone became mean-spirited, and he had become more distracted from paying attention to detail and safety precautions in his work. [15] His co-workers often called him \"Doctor Octopus\" behind his back, a pun on his actual name inspired by the four-armed apparatus; he was aware of this insult, but he barely cared. [13]   Criminal career begins [ edit ]  During an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Octavius\\'s body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from great distances. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was, in fact, his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs [16] ), and the scientist turned to a life of crime, first taking the hospital hostage and calling himself \"Doctor Octopus\" from the derogatory name that his co-workers had given him. [13] Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly, in poor physical shape, and is near-sighted , with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider-Man. The accident also made his eyes very sensitive to light , requiring him to wear glasses with shaded lenses. [17]  In their first encounter, Doctor Octopus defeated Spider-Man, tossing him out of a window. Following this defeat, Spider-Man considered giving up his heroic career but was inspired to continue by the Human Torch , and ultimately defeated Doctor Octopus. [13]  Over the years, Doctor Octopus has become one of the most identifiable members of Spider-Man\\'s rogues gallery . Doctor Octopus formed the original Sinister Six to fight Spider-Man after taking Betty Brant and May Parker hostage. [18] He has led subsequent Sinister Six groups and usually takes offense when someone else leads the team. Disguised as the Master Planner , he organized theft of atomic equipment. After he stole a formula that Spider-Man needed to cure his Aunt May, Spider-Man tracked Doctor Octopus\\' gang to their base. In the ensuing fight, Spider-Man became trapped underneath a collapsed building. Seemingly doomed, Spider-Man was ultimately able to draw upon the sheer force of his will to summon the strength to escape. [19] It is later revealed he used a scuba tank to escape. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Doctor Octopus later attempts to steal the Defense Department\\'s Nullifier device, and sets a trap for Spider-Man. [20] He became May Parker \\'s tenant, [21] then got close enough to use the Nullifier on Spider-Man; although he had hoped that it would merely nullify Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters, the radiation in Spider-Man\\'s blood resulted in the Nullifier\\'s interaction with Spider-Man\\'s unique biology rendering him amnesiac, [22] Doctor Octopus subsequently tricking Spider-Man into helping him before Spider-Man\\'s own better nature resulted in him turning against his \\'partner\\' despite his memory loss long enough for John Jameson to use the Nullifier to shut down his tentacles. [23]  Doctor Octopus later exhibited the ability to activate his mechanical arms remotely, and used them to free himself from prison. [24] His resulting battle with Spider-Man resulted in Captain George Stacy \\'s death. [25] Doctor Octopus later waged a gang war with Hammerhead . [26] He attempted to wed May Parker in order to acquire an island with an atomic plant which she had recently (and unknowingly) inherited. [27] Doctor Octopus escaped death when the island was destroyed in a thermonuclear explosion and began a life as a homeless person. [28] He next battled the \"ghost\" of Hammerhead, unwittingly returned him to his corporeal form using a particle accelerator and defeated him after forming a temporary alliance with Spider-Man. [29]  Doctor Octopus later attempted to hijack an atomic submarine. [30] He also attempted to poison New York City with printers\\' ink, and battled the Punisher and Spider-Man. [31] He next battled the Owl and his gang. [32] He successfully deactivated a nuclear reactor in a laboratory before meltdown. [33] He later displayed symptoms which Mister Fantastic diagnosed as multiple personality disorder. [34]  During the \" Secret Wars \" storyline, Doctor Octopus was taken to the Beyonder \\'s Battleworld , where he fought a horde of heroes and plotted against Doctor Doom for the leadership of the group of villains. He was able to defeat the X-Men , until Magneto came to the mutants\\' aid. [35]   Arachnophobia [ edit ]  His crowning achievement of evil was the near-fatal beating of the Black Cat (Spider-Man\\'s then-partner) which led to Spider-Man beating Doctor Octopus to within an inch of his life. The trauma of the beating he received from Spider-Man left Otto Octavius afraid of Spider-Man and spiders in general for years, and he needed to be treated for his acute arachnophobia . [36] Spider-Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow Octavius to break free of his fears and recruit him to save New York City from an exploding nuclear reactor; Octavius had been planning to detonate the reactor to kill Spider-Man indirectly, but after his out-of-control arms beat Spider-Man seemingly senseless, Spider-Man convinced him to shut down the reactor to ensure that there were witnesses to his \\'great triumph\\'. Octavius decided to let Spider-Man live on the grounds that he would now have to cope with the same humiliation he had endured. [37]   \"Death\" and resurrection [ edit ]  During the \" Clone Saga \", Doctor Octopus saved Spider-Man from certain death from a poison injected by the Vulture , although this was only because he desired to be the one to kill Spider-Man. [38] During the healing process, he discovered Spider-Man\\'s identity and then allowed himself to be taken in by police, expecting to be saved by his accomplice/lover Stunner. However, Stunner was knocked out and Doctor Octopus was murdered by the insane Spider-Man clone Kaine . [39]  Carolyn Trainer took over as \"Doctor Octopus\" until her teacher was resurrected by a branch of the mystical ninja cult known as the Hand . [40] Upon his resurrection, it was revealed that he now had no knowledge of Spider-Man\\'s identity, as the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by Carolyn Trainer, and the memory of Spider-Man\\'s identity had not been recorded at the time of his death. [41]   Subsequent schemes [ edit ]  In later years, Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed \" Spider-Woman \". He has also had to deal with another usurper, in the form of arrogant young businessman and con artist Luke Carlyle , who pretended to employ Octavius at his company. [42] Tiring of his life of crime and wishing to return to an engineering career, Octavius accepted the offer. This proved to be a ruse, and Carlyle subdued Doctor Octopus and stole his technology, using it to create his own version of Octavius\\' harness and tentacles. [43] During a prolonged battle with Octavius and Spider-Man, Carlyle was defeated when Doctor Octopus ripped open his suit, allowing Spider-Man to fill Carlyle\\'s suit with webbing, although Doctor Octopus informed his enemy that he only did this to hurt Carlyle rather than to help Spider-Man. [44]  Then, Doctor Octopus took the ambassador of the newly formed Free Palestinian State hostage, demanding that in exchange for the ambassador\\'s freedom, Spider-Man would meet him in Times Square and unmask himself in front of the world. When Spider-Man went to Times Square, he pulled off his mask to reveal another mask, angering Octavius enough to distract him from the release of the ambassador by agents of the Israeli Secret Service. [45]  Doctor Octopus was taken to Ryker\\'s Island and was drugged and brainwashed to kill the Green Goblin . He interrupted a battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin on the Brooklyn Bridge , and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below. Octopus was dragged out days later with no memory of the event and missing two months of his life. [46]  While hiding in a plant that was owned by the villain Fusion , Octavius was apparently forced to work for Fusion in helping him recover the \\'John Hancock\\' satellite, once used to find nuclear weapons but now capable of finding potentially radioactive superhumans such as the Hulk or Spider-Man. [47] Although Fusion had apparently forced Octavius into submission, Octavius eventually revealed that he had merely been faking his submission so that Fusion could do all the hard work of finding the satellite for Octavius to sell off, [48] subsequently beating Fusion half to death and attempting to sell the satellite himself before he was caught and defeated by Spider-Man. [49]   Civil War [ edit ]  Octavius unsuccessfully tried to form and lead another version of the Sinister Six , because Captain America \\'s Secret Avengers managed to defeat the villainous group, although Doctor Octopus himself eluded authorities. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] In Sensational Spider-Man #28, Doctor Octopus is seen viewing a telecast of Peter Parker revealing himself to be Spider-Man. Doctor Octopus then goes rampaging throughout the city, in utter disbelief that not only was he beaten numerous times by a teenager, but of the lost opportunity he had when he unmasked Parker in their second encounter (at the time, Octavius assumed he was an impostor). [50] He is again defeated by Spider-Man, who confronts Doctor Octopus unmasked, after two of Peter\\'s students distract Octavius. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] He is then sent to Baron Zemo \\'s supervillain detention facility (as seen in Thunderbolts #104 and Iron Man (vol. 4) #14). Later , Spider-Man contacts Octavius to see if he can help with Aunt May\\'s condition. [51]   Dying [ edit ]  When Doctor Octopus learns that he is dying due to the years of punishment his body took in his villainous career, facing superhuman foes when he is fundamentally human once getting past the tentacles, he becomes increasingly despondent and brazen in his final plans. Intending to leave a lasting legacy, he attempts to exert control over New York City by using his newly minted Octobots, but while he consciously intends to help, his subconscious drives him to turn the city\\'s resources against Spider-Man, and he also targets May Parker aggressively (deeming her guilty of being due to marry J. Jonah Jameson\\'s father J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.), subtly disrupting the planned marriage. Spider-Man is eventually able to take control of Octavius\\'s planned network, forcing Octavius to flee while vowing revenge. [52]  In his desperate attempts to prolong his life, Octavius reforms the Sinister Six, wishing to acquire Menace \\'s unborn son, hoping to synthesize a pure strain of the Goblin Serum, [53] only to be thwarted again by the efforts of Spider-Man and the guilty conscience of the Lizard, [54] reigniting his bitterness towards his foe, but gaining a grudging acknowledgment of his abilities. [55] Octavius and Spider-Man keep crossing their ways during the following months, with the Avengers fighting a new iteration of the Sinister Six, [55] Doctor Octopus sending a remote Octobot in John Jameson\\'s shuttle, [56] and Octavius contacting Iron Man to force him to find a cure for his degenerative condition. [57] However, when Iron Man genuinely offers to have the brightest minds in the Marvel Universe find a viable cure, [58] Octavius smugly refuses, in favor of witnessing Stark admit that he cannot do it and beg for mercy to disarm a device that Octavius had claimed was a bomb, basking in this \"proof\" of his (supposedly) superior intellect. [59]  His attempts to prolong his life, however, do not hinder a more vast and sinister plan, in which he has the Sinister Six fighting the Avengers Academy for a piece of Hank Pym \\'s technology, [60] the Future Foundation for a piece of Reed Richard \\'s technology, [61] and the Intelligencia for the Zero Cannon , a powerful antigravity weapon, [62] later revealing to have gained something useful from his early foray in John Jameson\\'s shuttle. [63] All this careful preparation came to fruition during the \" Ends of the Earth \" storyline, [64] where the apparently mismatched pieces of technology stolen are used to build a satellite net, the Octavian Lens , able to alter the world\\'s climate by enhancing or smothering solar rays. Doctor Octopus at first claims to have a benevolent intent, wishing to halt the greenhouse effect in exchange for gratitude and recognition, [65] but he is soon exposed by Spider-Man (having enhanced himself with new Horizon Labs-built tech), [66] the Black Widow and Silver Sable , who provoke him into revealing his real plan: immolate a great part of the entire population to prevent anyone from surviving his impending death, having the survivors remember him in perpetual fear and awe. [67] Playing over his ego, Spider-Man manages to stall him, by reminding him that, even if anyone managed to survive a drastic heating of the entire Earth, the survivors would likely be brain-damaged, and as such unable to remember his actions. [68] Spider-Man then roughly defeats him, in retaliation for Silver Sable\\'s death, openly mocking and berating his efforts by claiming that, because of the Octavian Lens\\' destruction and his declining health, he is now going to die alone, forgotten and without a legacy. [69]   \"Death\" and rebirth [ edit ]  Even captivity and incarceration were unable to stop Octavius. Since Spider-Man was forced to access the Octobots\\' hive mind several times in previous months, [66] [70] he unwittingly gave Octavius a full, unrestricted access to his mind and as such he becomes able to program a lone Octobot to swap their mind pattern. Octavius is now in Peter Parker\\'s body and able to access his foe\\'s memories, but with none of his restraints content of living his civilian life and planning for his future, while his foe is now trapped in Octavius\\' failing body. [71]  Peter is able to recruit the Scorpion , Hydro-Man and the Trapster with the task of keeping him alive and capturing \"Spider-Man\" in an attempt to reverse the mind swap. However, the Trapster\\'s portable life support can give Peter only 700 minutes to live. [72] As such, Peter openly antagonizes \"Spider-Man\". While Peter\\'s attempt to reclaim his body fails, he is able to imbue his nemesis with his very memories and values before apparently dying in Octavius\\' crippled body. Distraught, Octavius (in a sudden surge of empathy for his sworn nemesis) vows to steer himself away from villainy and accepts Peter\\'s dying wish of having a Spider-Man protect New York. Octavius claims that, since he now holds the physical might and the good values embodied by Spider-Man but also the boundless ambition and the scientific mindframe of Doctor Octopus, he will surpass the \"Amazing Spider-Man\", becoming a \" Superior Spider-Man \". [73]   The Superior Spider-Man [ edit ]  Within Spider-Man\\'s body, Octavius starts his new career as a hero by redesigning his gear and putting his past as a villain behind himself. [74] However, he soon finds himself the target of several villains, such as an Octavius-tech enhanced Stilt-Man , [75]  Boomerang , Overdrive , the Shocker , the Speed Demon , the new female Beetle , and the Living Brain , [76] all of them trying to take over the place left by the seemingly-dead Doctor Octopus and his Sinister Six. While they are still no match for the new, more ruthless Spider-Man, his violence and new mannerisms start to tip off several of his close friends and allies, such as the whole staff of Horizon Labs, Daredevil , [75]  Wolverine (explicitly forbidden to have Spider-Man\\'s mind telepathically scanned under the threat of legal action in court), [77]  Mary Jane Watson , [76] and Carlie Cooper . [78]  Despite his accomplishments, Octavius is revealed to be still haunted by Peter Parker\\'s lingering spirit, unable to reassert control over Spider-Man\\'s shared body, but actively hampering his efforts to stray from Peter\\'s values, and trying to reclaim his body. [78] Despite Peter\\'s lingering influence, Octavius\\'s refusal of Peter\\'s values and perceived screw-ups prompts him to \"rectify\" some mistakes: \"Peter\" enrolls back to college, pursuing actively the PhD Peter denied himself in the past, [79] and breaks the self-imposed \"no-kill rule\" by taking a proactive stance against evildoers and criminals, shooting the villain Massacre even after Massacre appeared to show signs of recovering from the brain damage that motivated his crimes, [80] and violently assaulting the Jester and Screwball for a relatively minor insult. [81] These actions prompted the Avengers to confront \"Spider-Man\" about his recent activities, recognizing that their friend would never act in such a manner. [82] When their subsequent analysis confirms that he is still biologically Peter Parker, Octavius explains that he is merely dealing with stress over recent events. [83]  Attempting a mind-wipe of all of Peter\\'s memories to destroy the living consciousness completely, Octavius manages to delete the Daily Bugle memory. Realizing Peter would not surrender, Octavius directly engages his foe in Spider-Man\\'s mind. After beating Peter to a pulp by breaking his spirit with the knowledge Peter was willing let a girl named Amy come close to death when Octavius was performing surgery on her with a scanner that would have detected him, Octavius declares his final victory while calling Peter unworthy to be called Spider-Man and believes that he deleted all of Spider-Man\\'s memories. Returning to the real world, Octavius rejoices from his belief that he is free and has achieved victory over Spider-Man. [84] But this erasure has also deprived him of Spider-Man\\'s memories, leaving it more difficult for him to pose as Spider-Man, with some of Peter\\'s friends (such as Carlie, Mary Jane, and J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.) questioning Spider-Man\\'s more brutal approach. [85] While Octavius has developed more detailed resources than Peter possessed as Spider-Man, such as creating a small army of Spider-bots and Spiderling allies to assist him, as well as helping Cyclops trap the body-hopping mutant Malice in a specially-designed containment unit, [86] he continues to resort to more questionable methods, such as killing Alistair Smythe , [87] and blackmailing Jameson into giving him free rein in New York by threatening to expose the fact that Jameson asked him to do this. During a series of confrontations with his former allies in the Sinister Six, he also attempted to brainwash them into becoming his new \\'team\\', resulting in him being forced to join forces with new hero Sun Girl when the Six snapped out of his control and tried to kill him. [88]  Octavius\\'s focus on the larger scale also resulted in him missing the Green Goblin\\'s efforts to establish a new criminal empire, with the Green Goblin rescuing criminals who have escaped Spider-Man and recruiting them into his new gang, as Octavius simply focused on the leaders whereas Peter would have tried to capture the whole gang. His fixation in proving himself Spider-Man\\'s superior reached a particular climax when Spider-Man 2099 came to the past to deal with a temporal anomaly, [89] with Octavius becoming so fixated with solving the problem and keeping his identity secret that he actually attacked the future Spider-Man rather than ask for his help, [90] his actions resulting in the destruction of Horizon Labs because he could not solve the vibranium -related equations that Peter was able to resolve. Unknown to Octavius, Peter\\'s memories managed to survive the deletion. When Octavius attempts to access Spider-Man\\'s memories (because Octavius can only view memories that were looked at before the delete), Peter is shown lifting the \\'rocks\\' off himself from the mental battle. [91]  When Carlie had found evidence that Doctor Octopus\\' mind is in Spider-Man\\'s body, she mourns Peter in Doctor Octopus\\' grave. The grave then collapses and Carlie falls in where she discovers that Doctor Octopus\\' body is not there. After Carlie has been captured by Menace, the Goblin King receives Carlie\\'s journal from Menace, where the Goblin King discovers evidence in it that states that Doctor Octopus\\' mind is in Spider-Man\\'s body. [92]  Following him being possessed by the Venom symbiote, Octavius receives unexpected help from Peter Parker\\'s consciousness, though Octavius is still unaware that Peter survived their mental duel. Peter decides to maintain a low profile until Octavius does something that will cause him to spring into action. [93] Peter finds that Octavius\\'s delete has left him with very few memories of his own, but after realizing those he still has are the ones that define him, vows not to give up, and that he will regain control of his body. [94] The Superior Spider-Man finds himself facing the full force of the Goblin Underground since the possession of the Venom symbiote 31 days ago. When the Superior Spider-Man finally confronts the Goblin King, he mentions that he knows about Doctor Octopus\\' mind-swap with Spider-Man. The Goblin King then makes his next move by having missiles targeted at Spider-Island II. [95]  Octavius survived the bombardment and escaped with the Living Brain. He then tries to find the Goblin King; however, before he can do so, Menace takes supporting character Anna Maria Marconi hostage. [96] Meanwhile, the Goblin destroys all the buildings that mean something to Octavius, to punish him for robbing the Goblin of his dream: Killing Spider-Man. Octavius is lured to Empire State University, where he finds Don Lamaze. During the ensuing fight, Lamaze takes a blade meant for Octavius and dies in the Superior Spider-Man\\'s arms. Heading to Alchemax, he is confronted by Spider-Man 2099, who takes control of the Spider-Slayers and demands answers. However, before he gets them, the Goblin King reactivates the Slayers to kill the Spiders, stating Norman Osborn now rules New York. [97] Although he manages to escape, Octavius is forced to realize that he has failed in his goal to be a \\'Superior\\' Spider-Man when the restored Peter Parker takes over to save a child from a runaway train where Octavius hesitated, reflecting that he is aware of his fundamental inferiority, as he overcompensates while Peter holds himself back, but acts when he has to. Octavius then willingly deletes his own consciousness so that Peter can regain control of his body. As Octavius\\'s last memories fade, it is shown he had really fallen in love with Anna Maria, much to Peter\\'s surprise. Octavius tells Peter he is willing to give up his love to keep her safe - something only Peter can do as the true Superior Spider-Man - and urges the hero to save New York in his place. [98]   Spider-Verse [ edit ]  In the run-up to Spider-Verse , Octavius was sent to the year 2099 by accident while dealing with the temporal anomalies caused by Horizon\\'s time portal. [99] Trapped in the future, he attempted to return home by creating a dimensional portal, but found himself travelling to various alternate universes – including one where Spider-Man joined the Fantastic Four and a variation of the House of M – where all the Spider-Men were dead. Realizing that something was hunting Spider-Men across other dimensions, Octavius began to gather some of the more ruthless Spider-Men into a team that could oppose whatever was killing them, including Spider-Man Noir, a multi-armed Spider-Man, Pavitr Prabhakar, and a Peter Parker working in black ops with Wolverine. [100] As the crisis unfolds, Octavius takes command of a group of alternate Spider-Men, considering himself particularly qualified to lead them due to his unique nature and willingness to kill, [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] but when his team is confronted by another group led by the Peter Parker of Earth-616 – who Octavius presumes is a past Peter as he cannot contemplate the possibility that he will fail- he is forced to concede to Peter\\'s leadership when Peter defeats him in a fight, Peter stating that killing Morlun and the Inheritors is not the answer, as they will just come back, and they need a new plan. [101] Although he realizes that Peter comes from his future when Peter recognizes Anna Maria\\'s name, Otto is forced to acknowledge his own failures when he learns that another Earth where Ben Parker was the Spider-Totem was reduced to a nuclear wasteland due to the actions of his own local counterpart. [102]  To stop the Inheritors from traveling around the multiverse, hunting all animal totems as fast as possible, Octavius identified the Master Weaver as the source of their abilities to traverse the multiverse, and killed him. However, Morlun feared the consequences of this action, [103] resulting in Karn, the surviving defected Inheritor, taking the Weaver\\'s place (although it was noted that the Weaver was actually Karn\\'s future self, creating a complex temporal paradox). Having learned that he was \\'destined\\' to be replaced by Peter Parker, Octavius attempted to attack the multiversal web to \\'save\\' himself from his destiny, claiming that he was giving the spiders the \\'gift\\' of free will, but the Earth-616 spiders were able to defeat him as their surviving allies returned to their home dimensions. Before he departed, Octavius issued a time-delayed message to the Anna Maria program, intended to activate 100 days after he returned to his home time, but upon his return to his time, his memory of his time with the Spider-Army is erased, allowing history to unfold as it should. [104]   All-New, All-Different Marvel [ edit ]  As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel event, Otto Octavius is still dead but a copy of his consciousness is shown to be inside the Living Brain where he is still in love with Anna Maria Maraconi. [105] Following the events of Spider-Verse , Otto Octavius had backed up his consciousness in one of his gauntlets (the Superior Spider-Man\\'s web-shooters) that slept for 100 days using the technology he acquired from 2099. [106] [107] The gauntlet housed a copy of Octavius\\'s consciousness up to the point of Spider-Verse (without the memories of learning about power and responsibility for his act of self-sacrifice in Goblin Nation , as this copy would remain asleep during this time). After transforming the gauntlet into a version of an Octobot, he backed himself up in the Living Brain while waiting for the next opportunity to take over Parker\\'s body again, planning to act at a time when Parker\\'s spider-sense would be taxed so that he would miss the relevant signals. [106]  At the time when the Living Brain was at Parker Industries\\' London branch, Doctor Octopus\\' consciousness expresses anger over being forced to act like their lackey. After Sajani Jaffrey is fired by Peter Parker for conspiring against him, Doctor Octopus\\' consciousness smirks as Anna is made the head of Parker Industries\\' London branch. [108]   \"Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy\" [ edit ]  During the \" Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy \" storyline, Peter decides to have Parker Industries get familiar with New U Enterprises\\' \"New U\" system, which is a program where replacement organs are cloned for those suffering from serious injuries. Upon hearing about it from within the Living Brain, Doctor Octopus\\' consciousness expresses an interest in the procedure. [109] When Peter Parker scanned the Living Brain to find out why it was acting unusually, Doctor Octopus\\' consciousness asked why it was erased. Realizing the truth, Peter Parker shut down the Living Brain, only for Doctor Octopus\\' consciousness to reactivate it and cause it to self-destruct while escaping in the Octobot. Arriving at New U Enterprises, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot plans to get his biological body back, convinced that the consciousness in Parker\\'s body was \"infected\" by its time in Spider-Man to believe that Peter was superior rather than himself. [106] Upon heading to Potter\\'s Field, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot finds that Doctor Octopus\\' body was grave-robbed, alongside those of Alistair Alphonso Smythe and other villains. It traces the grave robbery to New U Technologies. Finding Doctor Octopus\\' body, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot allowed it to be cloned and perfected. After eliminating the copy of Peter Parker\\'s consciousness, Doctor Octopus gains control of the clone body and emerges from the vat where he resembles his earlier appearance. The Jackal was present where he presents him with his tentacle pack. Now an ally of the Jackal, Doctor Octopus receives the special New U Pills to prevent his body from suffering clone degeneration. [110]  When Spider-Man later infiltrates New U Technologies after witnessing video footage of one of its subjects suffering from cellular degeneration, he evades the initial security force, including the Rhino and the female Electro . When he discovers what appears to be Gwen Stacy, he is distracted long enough to be caught off-guard by the reborn Octavius, once again in his own body with new tentacles. [111] With Spider-Man trapped in his tentacles, Doctor Octopus tells him that he is not a clone or a hologram, but the real Otto Octavius. [110]  After Silk escapes from New U Technologies, Doctor Octopus attacks Spectro who was unable to phase through the walls with the test subject. Doctor Octopus and Spectro fight until Electro arrives and knocks out Spectro. Doctor Octopus later experiments with Spectro and plans to put him into a cloned body. [112]  While studying the clones of Kaine and Electro in order to perfect the Proto-Clone, Anna Maria was brought to Otto and she becomes uncomfortable when Doctor Octopus starts appealing towards his love interest. When the Jackal enters the laboratory, Anna Maria reveals she knows how to stop the decaying process on the clones and the Jackal offers her the \"Proto-Clone\" body in exchange for the formula. Octavius takes offense to the Jackal\\'s comments on Maria\\'s dwarfism and attacks his boss. Then he pulls a switch which activates the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying. [113]  Doctor Octopus fights the Jackal to allow Peter and Anna Maria the time to transmit the frequency, Spider-Man correctly anticipating that Octavius would act to protect Anna regardless of their own history. The frequency has a huge effect on Doctor Octopus and the Jackal. Upon checking New U Technologies\\' Haven following the broadcast, Spider-Man and Anna Maria find that Ben Reilly, Doctor Octopus, and Gwen Stacy have been seemingly reduced to dust. [114] It was later revealed that Doctor Octopus rendered Ben Reilly unconscious and escaped by transmitting his mind into the Proto-Clone (a perfect clone of Peter Parker) before Ben Reilly could. [115]   Becoming the Superior Octopus [ edit ]  With his new body, Otto Octavius returns to one of his old bases only to find it is being occupied by HYDRA. He defeats the HYDRA soldiers, but is then recruited into HYDRA by Arnim Zola . Zola grants him the leadership of some HYDRA soldiers to work for him in arranging the destruction of Parker Industries . With HYDRA\\'s help, he creates a new uniform for himself, becoming the Superior Octopus, intending to wait for Peter\\'s actions to trigger the collapse of Parker Industries so that he can retake his position and prove himself superior once again. [116]   \"Secret Empire\" [ edit ]  During the 2017 \" Secret Empire \" storyline, the Superior Octopus appears as a leader of HYDRA\\'s Avengers. [117] Outside of his work with HYDRA\\'s Avengers, the Superior Octopus approached Spider-Man, where he wants him to transfer ownership of Parker Industries back to him. When Peter Parker declined this offer, the Superior Octopus had the HYDRA agents in Parker Industries\\' London branch blow up the building. [118] As Peter flees to the Shanghai branch of Parker Industries, Octavius attempts to implement various security protocols he had added to all Parker Industries tech that allows him to retake control of anything developed by the company, [119] but Peter turns the tables on Octavius by ordering his employees to literally destroy the company in order to hurt HYDRA, thwarting Octavius\\' attempt to shut down his new high-tech suit with an EMP by reverting to his traditional costume and turning the EMP trick against Octavius so that his own tentacles attack him. Octavius is forced to flee the battle. [120]   Go Down Swinging and redemption [ edit ]  During the Go Down Swinging story arc where the Red Goblin (Norman Osborn who has powered himself up with the Carnage symbiote ) attacks Spider-Man and all his friends and family, the Superior Octopus and J. Jonah Jameson help defend Aunt May as the Superior Octopus still retains some of Peter\\'s memories and sense of responsibility. This concludes with Peter forgiving the Superior Octopus and giving him a \"clean slate\". In the aftermath of Osborn\\'s defeat , the Superior Octopus reveals his new identity as Dr. Elliot Tolliver, a person who has just started working at Horizon University. He was seen applying for a job under Max Modell as Anna Maria starts acting suspicious towards Dr. Elliot Tolliver. [121]   \"Spider-Geddon\" [ edit ]  During the \" Spider-Geddon \" storyline, the Superior Octopus is seen fighting the Night Shift . The Superior Octopus agrees to spare them more pain in exchange for the Night Shift becoming his agents, where he will compensate them from his own funds. They agree to the terms and are ordered to return the stolen items. The Superior Octopus leaves, advising them never to cross him or they will not live long enough to regret it. After a day at Horizon University and saving some people on the Bay Bridge, the Superior Octopus fights Arnim Zola, a bio-duplicate of Gorgon , and some HYDRA agents who seek to repossess his services to rebuild HYDRA. The Superior Octopus states that he is done with his end of the bargain and attacks them. When the Gorgon bio-duplicate turns the Superior Octopus to stone and shatters him, another Superior Octopus body emerges, where it destroys the Gorgon bio-duplicate and defeats Arnim Zola , while informing him to spread the word to HYDRA to never come for him again. The Superior Octopus\\' inner monologue states that he had perfected Miles Warren \\'s cloning technology where each clone had to be made from the deceased in order to maintain their memories as a way to conquer death. [122] However, after Octavius forces Count Nefaria into retreating from Los Angeles, he is confronted in his cloning workshop by the Spider-Army. They reveal that his cloning process has been \\'hacked\\' by the Inheritors, who fed his computers hours-old data until they were ready to manifest, with these new Inheritors swiftly killing Spider-Man Noir and Spider-UK. Octavius then quotes \"What have I done...\" [123] After initiating his base\\'s self-destruct sequence to slow down the Inheritors, the Superior Octopus states that they still should have killed the Inheritors while they had the chance. Upon heading to his lab at Horizon High to change into his Superior Spider-Man appearance, he goes to recruit Kaine and states that they should leave Ben Reilly out of the fight, since Jennix is targeting the cloning technology from the now-defunct New U Technologies. As the Superior Spider-Man and Kaine enter the portal, they are unaware that Ben Reilly has followed them. [124] The Superior Spider-Man heads to Earth-1048 to recruit that world\\'s Spider-Man , where he helps to defeat the Tarantula and learned about his counterpart. [125] After Spider-Norman and Spiders-Man sundered Earth-616\\'s connection to the Web of Life and Destiny, Octavius seemingly betrayed Ben, giving him to the Inheritors in exchange for the other Spiders being left alone. [126] When Spider-Man of Earth-1048, who had been secretly following both Octavius and Ben from behind, believed Octavius made the same mistake as his counterpart in betraying their own, Octavius revealed to him that he and Ben purposely planned this to trick the Inheritors into consuming the clone that will drove them insane, starting from when he was forced to relive the memories of Ben\\'s 29 deaths and resurrections. With the help from surviving Spider-Men who are trapped in Earth-616, including those who were trapped in another universe (including Kaine and 616\\'s Peter), Octavius manages to resurrect Ben in his 30th resurrection. With the Inheritors turned into babies to be raised by Spider-Ma\\'am (Aunt May) for their redemption; the same goes for Morlun, who is currently in 616\\'s high-security prison. Octavius resumes being the Superior Spider-Man. [127]   The Superior Spider-Man (vol. 2) [ edit ]  After the events of \"Spider-Geddon\", Octavius resumes his career as the Superior Spider-Man once again, protecting San Francisco with the hired assistance of the Night Shift. His identity as Dr. Elliot Tolliver is uncovered by Anna Maria, who confronts him with the rebuilt Living Brain, but the appearance of Terrax the Tamer gives Octavius a chance to temporarily evade this. Despite lacking the weaponry, technology and the Night Shift\\'s assistance (who ran away in fear after one of their undead members is cut in half) to take on Terrax, Octavius refuses to back down despite being heavily injured during the fight against him. With help from Anna Maria and the Night Shift, Octavius is able to use a device to siphon a fraction of Terrax\\'s Power Cosmic and transfer it to himself, giving him cosmic powers. Despite this upgrade, Octavius is still unable to defeat Terrax until he is able to change the frequency of the latter\\'s axe and trick him into taking it back, causing a feedback which shocks Terrax unconscious. With the fight over, Octavius returns the Power Cosmic back to the machine and passes out. When he awakens, he is being treated by Anna Maria, who decides that she will help Otto be a real hero but if he ever returns to his Doctor Octopus persona, she will have him arrested or worse. Octavius agrees to this, believing she would make the perfect partner for him. [128] While helping the authorities rebuild San Francisco and rescue survivors, the Superior Spider-Man learns about humility and begins to connect with the people. Unbeknownst to him, Master Pandemonium emerges from the wreckage, planning to strike. [129] When Master Pandemonium attacks, the Superior Spider-Man is forced to work with Doctor Strange to stop Pandemonium after he possesses Elliot Tolliver\\'s new associate Emma Hernandez, revealing in flashbacks that the two met before they adopted their later identities, with Doctor Strange rejecting a request to help Octavius develop the original harness and Octavius later ignoring the now-destitute Strange after the accident. While fighting Master Pandemonium, the two are forced to \\'swap\\' for a time, with Doctor Strange using the Superior Spider-Man\\'s \\'spinnerets\\' to operate on Pandemonium and shut him down, while the Superior Spider-Man uses the Cloak of Levitation. At the fight\\'s conclusion, the Superior Spider-Man asks if Doctor Strange could cast the same spell that he used to make the world forget about Peter\\'s identity. Doctor Strange rejects that request, as the original spell could only be cast under specific circumstances and in any case he feels that it does the Superior Spider-Man good to have people aware of his past so that he will not be tempted to \"regress.\" [130]  During the \" War of the Realms \" storyline, the Superior Spider-Man worked to save the civilians from a Frost Giant invasion. Then he came up with the idea to work with the West Coast Avengers in order to make use of America Chavez \\'s powers. After rescuing them with his Octavian Lens, the Superior Spider-Man barely convinced them to help fight the Asgardian invasion at the source. They would have to go to New York City, since the Asgardian magic is interfering with America\\'s powers. [131] In the midst of the battle between the Fantastic Four and Malekith the Accursed \\'s forces, the Superior Spider-Man worked with Mister Fantastic to enable America Chavez to duplicate the Bifrost Bridge\\'s energy. After the two of them failed to locate the strike team in Svartalfheim, the Superior Spider-Man and Mister Fantastic located the strike team in Jotunheim. Those in Jotunheim persuaded the Superior Spider-Man to focus on protecting Earth. The Superior Spider-Man returned to New York City to lead the West Coast Avengers in protecting the citizens. [132]  Once the War was over, the Superior Spider-Man received an award from the city for his role in its defense, but the Superior Spider-Man found himself troubled by the ceremony, confessing to Spider-Man later that he felt as though he should have been able to save more. Offering his own experience as a hero, Spider-Man consoled the Superior Spider-Man by observing that Octavius\\'s feeling this hurt over random deaths proved that he was moving on from his old villainous history. Unbeknownst to Elliot Tolliver on his date with Emma Hernandez, he is being spied upon by one of the spiders that make up Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 on behalf of Norman Osborn of Earth-44145. After being told the information he received from Spiders-Man of Earth-11580, Norman Osborn of Earth-44145 begins his revenge plans on the Superior Spider-Man. [133] Following a date with Emma Hernandez, they notice a news leak that asks if the Superior Spider-Man is really Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man, Mister Fantastic, and Doctor Strange had noted their collaboration with the Superior Spider-Man and his involvement in fighting the Frost Giants. Even the Brothers Grimm made their comment about working for them. The next day, Max Modell calls Elliot Tolliver to his office, where Tolliver admits that he is the Proto-Clone created by New U Technologies and is hosting Otto Octavius\\' mind. Modell stated that he already knew of him being the Proto-Clone and the Superior Spider-Man, as well as stating that he believes in second chances. Upon analyzing the security footage of the leak, the Superior Spider-Man finds small spiders and figures out that Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 was responsible. Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 attacks them as the Superior Spider-Man uses a Wave Disruption Field to trap the main spider. Getting a confession from him, Superior Spider-Man reveals to Modell about the Norman Osborn of Earth-44145, who operates as the Spider-Man of his reality. Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 states that Spider-Man of Earth-44145 is safe on his world and that they will never reach him. In Horizon University\\'s sub-basement two, Superior Spider-Man states that they will not be able to power the dimensional transporter without something that can replicate the energies of the Cosmic Cube. Anna Maria and the Living Brain revealed that they harnessed the cosmic energies from the fight with Terrax in the Cosmic Harness invention. When the Living Brain enters the cosmic energies into the system, he starts to overload and it causes an explosion. As the Superior Spider-Man holds up the rubble, Spider-Man of Earth-44145 appears, revealing that he was on Earth-616 all this time thanks to the fragment of the Web of Life and Destiny that he holds that enables him to travel to different dimensions. Upon knocking down the Superior Spider-Man, Spider-Man of Earth-44145 reveals that he is going to kill everyone that he cares about as part of his revenge on the Superior Spider-Man for insulting him. [134] While rescue crews get most of those caught in the explosion to safety, Spiders-Man and Spider-Osborn defeat Dansen Macabre, Digger, and Skein before Spider-Osborn captures James Martin, stating that he will release the boy only if Octavius kills three citizens on camera (forbidding him from \\'cheating\\' by targeting criminals or the terminally ill) so that people will see that the \\'Superior Spider-Man\\' is a fraud. With no way to call for help from the Avengers or other heroes without endangering James, and believing that he cannot win against Osborn as he is, Octavius uses a signal move he learned from Doctor Strange to call Mephisto , who states that Spider-Man of Earth-44145 is out of his jurisdiction. Octavius asks Mephisto to restore him to the man he once was for a day so that he can fight Spider-Man of Earth-44145, but Mephisto rejects that request, musing that he may already have Octavius\\'s soul anyway, and makes a counter-offer; he will permanently restore Octavius to his original body, with no trait of disease or any of the \\'taints\\' he picked up from Peter Parker. Anna Maria attempts to convince Octavius that it is too great of a risk, while Mephisto mocks Octavius with his old claims that he was only a criminal due to brain damage from the bond with his original arms as he simultaneously \\'assures\\' Octavius that such a taint will not be a factor now. Later, the Brothers Grimm are attacked by the apparently restored Doctor Octopus as they collect their payment, with Octopus demanding the location of Spider-Man of Earth-44145 from them or else they will die. [135] Using a clone of Elliot Tolliver, Doctor Octopus gets to Spider-Man of Earth-44145 and uses his old harnesses to defeat him. Using the Web of Life and Destiny, Doctor Octopus throws Spider-Man of Earth-44145 back to his world. After briefly visiting Anna Maria and Emma at the hospital, during which he reveals that he has lost all memory of the original Spider-Man\\'s identity, Doctor Octopus watches the funeral for Elliot from afar. Digger is informed to distribute the severance pay to the remaining members of the Night Shift so they will not bother him again and to warn them not to go visit the Brothers Grimm in the hospital. Doctor Octopus then walks away, leaving his Superior Spider-Man outfit in the garbage. [136]   Powers and abilities [ edit ]  Otto Octavius is a genius in the field of atomic physics , and he holds a Ph. D. in nuclear science. A brilliant engineer and inventor, he is also a superb strategist and a charismatic leader. His genius in radiation is so exceptional that he was once called upon by Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four to offer his expertise when the Invisible Woman suffered from complications during her second pregnancy as a result of the cosmic radiation that had given the team their powers. [34]  Due to exposure to atomic radiation, Doctor Octopus has acquired the mental ability of psychokinetic control over the four electrically powered, telescoping, prehensile , titanium -steel artificial tentacle \"arms\" (a degree of psychokinetic control over them that he can also exercise over vast distances even when they are not connected to him) that are attached to a stainless-steel harness encompassing his lower torso. Each of these four arms is capable of lifting several tons, provided that at least one arm is used to support his body. The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages are enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature. The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings. He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent, like Spider-Man , or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate, more delicate task, such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine. Due to his weight and age, his opponents are often lured into a false sense of security, only to find he is a formidable combatant. He has managed to force opponents as formidable as Spider-Man, Daredevil , and Captain America to take up a defensive position in a fight. [137]  Doctor Octopus has also employed an armored body suit enabling him to breathe underwater and designed to withstand extreme water pressure. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]  Doctor Octopus has begun wearing a full-body armor suit due to a crippling illness caused by the amount of punishment he has sustained over the years, made even worse by the fact that his ability to take damage is still at a human norm, even if he can deliver a superhuman level of punishment; he relies completely on his arms to prevent opponents with superhuman strength getting in close enough to damage his relatively unfit physical form even before his illness. To compensate, he has covered his entire body with his new suit, his normal arms are bound to his chest, and four additional tentacles have been added to his harness. He has also developed psychokinetic-telepathic control over an army of \"Octobots\" (small octopus -like drones). [52]   Harnesses [ edit ]  Doctor Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original titanium harness, a more powerful adamantium harness, and a carbonadium harness with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The titanium and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man #1-4. His current harness is made of a titanium-steel-niobium alloy mixture that is dense, but lightweight in composition. While wearing the harness, the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move about quickly. They are also used to grab items, both small and large, and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs. The pincers at the end of each tentacle can also be used to cut and tear into the flesh of his enemies. His sheer power using these appendages was great enough to beat Daredevil , a seasoned combatant with superhuman senses, almost to death. [138]  The adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the Hulk into submission during a series written by Erik Larsen. The adamantium in his tentacles made besting Iron Man in combat possible, tearing the hero\\'s armor apart with a defeat so harsh that Tony Stark began to doubt his abilities almost enough to allow his persistent problem with alcohol abuse to flare up. [139] The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack, allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider-Man more easily. Doctor Octopus is even capable of whirling his tentacles around to deflect small projectiles like bullets.  Powers as the Superior Spider-Man [ edit ]  With his mind having taken over Spider-Man\\'s body, [71] Octavius gains possession of all of Spider-Man\\'s memories, powers, abilities, and equipment, [73] although he loses access to Spider-Man\\'s memories after apparently removing his foe from their shared mind. [84] As a way to reaffirm his perceived superior mind, he tinkered with the original Spider-Man costume, adding some carbonadium plating over his neck and skull, [73] talons on his hands and feet, split-toed footwear fashioned as jika-tabi shoes, a slightly different, more imposing spider-motif on his back and enhanced lenses in his costume, with HUD and tracking abilities. [74]  He also retains access to some of his former hideouts from when he was Doctor Octopus, coupling Horizon Tech-derived inventions with his own peculiar brand of technology. [74]   Octobots [ edit ]  The Octobots are octopus-themed robots that are created by Doctor Octopus. There are two different kinds of Octobots:  The first model of the Octobot seen are little metal balls with eight legs, which are mentally controlled by Doctor Octopus via a remote control. These Octobots can also be used to attack, to perform different tasks, and attach themselves to anyone so that Doctor Octopus can mentally control them.  The second model of the Octobot seen is a giant metallic robot, which Doctor Octopus uses to attack huge constructions.  The Octobots have at least two known variations:  The Spider-Slayers – These Spider-Slayers that appeared in Spider-Island are actually first generation Octobots that Spider-Man had laden with a special serum, which was used to cure the Spider-Virus that slowly turned everyone into Man-Spiders.  The Spider-Bots – The Spider-Bots are small red and blue spiders. While his mind was inside Spider-Man\\'s body, he controlled them remotely and was able to enact constant surveillance over all of New York city, perform different tasks and control technology.  Powers as the Superior Octopus [ edit ]  In his Superior Octopus body, Octavius retains access to Peter Parker\\'s powers, while also having a new set of his original tentacles designed to work with this body. [116]   Other versions [ edit ]  Age of Ultron [ edit ]  In the Age of Ultron reality of Earth-61112 where the evil AI robot Ultron returned to Earth and annihilated humanity and a majority of the world\\'s superheroes, it was revealed that sometime prior to Ultron\\'s conquest, the events of Dying Wish had still occurred, as Peter Parker is revealed to be Otto Octavius. [140]   Amalgam [ edit ]  In the Amalgam Comics universe, Doctor Octopus is a benevolent scientist, a member of Project Cadmus , and a mentor figure to the young hero Spider-Boy. [141]   House of M [ edit ]  In the House of M reality created by the Scarlet Witch , Otto Octavius makes an appearance as a researcher for the government where he is seen studying stem cells. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Marvel 1602 [ edit ]  In the Marvel 1602 universe, a version of Dr. Octopus appears in the Spider-Man 1602 miniseries.

[144]  In the prequel series to Marvel Zombies , Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness and Marvel Zombies: Dead Days , the zombie Doctor Octopus makes only a few cameo appearances , as a member of the undead Sinister Six. Another alternate version appears in Marvel Zombies Return as a member of the Sinister Six. He was ripped in half and infected by the reality-hopping Zombie Spider-Man. The zombie Doctor Octopus\\'s body is then destroyed and devoured by a zombified Spider-Man and then spit out (because zombie flesh tastes terrible to other zombies) after he and the rest of the Sinister Six have devoured Peter\\'s friends. [145]   MC2 [ edit ]  In the MC2 alternate continuity , Doctor Octopus attacked the Daily Bugle shortly after the disappearance/retirement of Spider-Man, killing editor-in-chief Joseph \"Robbie\" Robertson . This motivates Bugle publisher J. Jonah Jameson to initiate \"Project: Human Fly\", an attempt to create a government-controlled superhero. Mercenaries (later revealed to be in the employ of Doctor Octopus) attempt to steal the Human Fly suit, but are thwarted when Jameson\\'s grandson takes the suit (the controls of which bond to the first user) and becomes the superhero the Buzz . The Buzz and Spider-Girl eventually apprehend Doctor Octopus, who—now being struck with cancer—falls into a coma from which he is not expected to recover. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] Later, the mantle of Doctor Octopus is taken up by Lady Octopus . [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ]   Marvel Noir [ edit ]  In the Spider-Man Noir series as part of the Marvel Noir universe, his name first appears in the Daily Bugle newspaper as one of the biologists undertaking an oceanic voyage on a research ship named the Atlantis . [146] He appears in person in issue #1 of the sequel series, \"Eyes Without a Mask\". Here, he is a doctor working in a facility on Ellis Island . His legs are crippled and withered, and he travels in a wheelchair with six long metal claw-like tentacles sticking out. He is officially conducting experiments on primates to study their brains in connection with evolution and, in the end, it is shown he is secretly taking in kidnapped African Americans for his own, more secret experiments. He is later revealed to in fact be working with the Nazis and their American proxies, the \" Friends of New Germany \", with the plot of making all minorities into mindless slaves. However, his experiments are uncovered by Spider-Man, and although he is allowed to leave the country due to his past service to America, he is subsequently rejected by the Nazis, as they believe his crippled body reflects a crippled mind that could produce nothing of value for them. [147]   Spider-Gwen [ edit ]  In the Spider-Gwen reality of Earth-65, Doctor Octopus is the head scientist of S.I.L.K. He engages the 616 version of his boss Cindy Moon with an experimental octopus that attaches to him. [148]   Spider-Man: Chapter One [ edit ]  Otto Octavius appears in the Spider-Man: Chapter One re-imagining of Spider-Man\\'s origin. This version of the character was transformed into Doctor Octopus in the same accident that caused a spider to become radioactive, leading to Peter Parker\\'s transformation into Spider-Man. [149]   Spider-Man: Life Story [ edit ]  Spider-Man: Life Story features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962 as in the original timeline. In the 1970s, Octavius gave up being Doctor Octopus after suffering a heart attack, making him afraid of his own mortality. He eventually married May Parker and was offered a job at Future Foundations by Reed Richards. However, May later divorced him due to his anger management issues, leading him to a life of crime once more. In 1995, Norman Osborn tells him Spider-Man\\'s secret identity and reveals he has a clone named Ben Reilly in Chicago. An elderly Octavius kidnaps Peter and Ben and takes them to Oscorp (after threatening Harry for the equipment) so he could learn how to clone himself a new body. While studying them, he discovers that Peter was supposedly the clone while Ben was the original, leading Ben to lash out at him. He attempts to kill both Peter and Ben, but ends up accidentally killing Harry and runs away in shock. Peter later discovers that Norman rigged the machines Octavius was using to make it appear that he was the clone. In 2019, the dying Octavius switches bodies with the newer, younger Spider-Man, Miles Morales, in order to preserve his life and become a \"superior\" hero. He aids the older Peter Parker in activating the \"Doomsday Pulse\" in space to shut down Doctor Doom\\'s technology across the planet. After they encounter a Venom-possessed Kraven the Hunter, Peter deduces that Octavius is in Miles\\' body from his interactions with Kraven and his technical knowledge. Octavius attempts to destroy Peter\\'s mind, but Peter uses a memory of Aunt May to convince him to accept his life\\'s limitations. Peter sends Octavius back to Earth with the space station\\'s only escape pod and sacrifices himself to activate the Doomsday Pulse. After his return, Octavius willingly puts himself and Miles back in their original bodies. [150]   Spider-Man: India [ edit ]  In Spider-Man: India , Doctor Octopus is featured as a minion/meek doctor who is transformed by Nalin Oberoi into a mystical version of Doctor Octopus to find and kill Pavitr Prabhaker, the Indian version of Spider-Man. [151] He is later killed by Oberoi, while trying to help Spider-Man rescue MJ and Aunt Maya from Oberoi. [152]   Spider-Man: Reign [ edit ]  In Spider-Man: Reign , as conceived by Kaare Andrews , in which many superheroes had grown old and retired, Octavius appeared to save Spider-Man from death at the hands of an older version of the Sinister Six . [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] While he originally appeared to merely be world-weary, relying on his \\'four sons\\' (his tentacles) to keep him alive, he revealed via monologue that he had in fact been dead for months, and had left the tentacles a program that would force them into action to find Spider-Man. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] Furthermore, the tentacles were used to play the tape on which his monologue is recorded, and take him to the graveyard where his loved ones lay. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] The hope is to use Spider-Man to reignite the age of the super powered beings, as both Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man were born from nuclear accidents. [153]   Secret Wars [ edit ]  During the Secret Wars storyline, there had been different versions of Doctor Octopus in different Battleworld domains.  In the Battleworld Domain of the Regency as seen in Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows , Doctor Octopus is a member of Regent\\'s Sinister Six where they are tasked to hunt down Spider-Man. [154] He catches Spider-Man at Tinkerer\\'s shop when the Sinister Six was tipped off by Tinkerer. Doctor Octopus is killed by Spider-Man before the rest of the Sinister Six could arrive. [155]  In the Battleworld domain of the Valley of Doom, Otto Octavius has metal arms that wield revolvers under his coat. He is depicted as a minion of Governor Roxxon alongside Bullseye, Elektra, and Grizzly where they are first seen intimidating Judge Franklin Nelson into leaving town so that he wouldn\\'t preside over Red Wolf \\'s trial. The four villains fight Sheriff Steve Rogers and Red Wolf on Mayor Wilson Fisk\\'s behalf which ended with Otto Octavius getting killed in battle against Sheriff Rogers. [156]  In the Battleworld domain of Marville, Doctor Octopus appears as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. [157]  In the Battleworld domain of Killville, Doctor Octopus had stolen as CPU unit from a defeated Nimrod Sentinel. Although MODOK saved Doctor Octopus from Bullseye, MODOK killed Doctor Octopus and claimed the CPU unit for himself. [158]  In a world where the superhero Civil War never ended and was recreated into the Battleworld domain of the Warzone, Doctor Octopus was killed by the Kingpin , who grafted Doctor Octopus\\'s tentacles onto himself. The tentacles\\' own collective AI rendered Fisk virtually brain-dead due to their \\'affection\\' for Octavius. [159]  Spider-Verse [ edit ]  A version of Doctor Octopus is a member of the Six Men of Sinestry of the dimension Earth-803, set in Industrial Age New York. Their objective was to steal the mayor\\'s plan, but although they succeeded in the theft, they were forced to retreat after a battle with Lady Spider. [160] In a later confrontation with Lady Spider and Spider-Man 2099 , Miguel manages to examine Octopus\\'s equipment and notes that it is powered by a radioactive material with improper shielding, musing that he would be dead of cancer within a year if he kept using the tentacles. [161]  In a world where Ben Parker was the Spider-Totem, Doctor Octopus attempted to blackmail the world with a stolen nuclear device. Even though the demands were met, something went wrong and most of Earth was reduced to a nuclear wasteland, with Ben Parker only surviving because he was hidden in Ezekiel\\'s bunker after the deaths of his family at the hands of the Emerald Elf drove him to retire. [102]  On Earth-94, a reality where Ben Reilly was never killed and continued to be Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus was unable to transfer his mind into Spider-Man and died. [162]  After various assorted Electros expand out to become a multiverse-conquering army, the lead Electro – a Max Dillon who used his powers to become a major world leader - gathers a variety of alternate Doctor Octopuses to become their \\'think tank\\'. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] When Gwen Stacy and Uncle Ben attempted to free the Octaviuses from the Electros\\' control, the various villains attacked them, but they found an ally in the form of Octavia Otto, a teenage female Doctor Octopus who was a member of the Young Avengers in her universe, allowing them to devise a means of adapting the Octaviuses\\' mind-switching technology to disrupt the neural pattern of the leader of the Electro army, who had converted himself into a purely electricity-based life form. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] Octavia meets with the Superior Octopus when she joins the Spider-Army to warn him about the Inheritors\\' hi-jacking his cloning technology to escape their prison.  Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man [ edit ]  In the 1976 DC / Marvel intercompany crossover Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man , Doctor Octopus forms an alliance with fellow criminal scientist Lex Luthor , in an effort to conquer the world and kill their archenemies—Spider-Man and Superman . However, once he realizes that Luthor intends to destroy most of the planet Earth, Octopus betrays Luthor and attempts to stop him, but is defeated (Spider-Man subsequently defeats Luthor, and Superman prevents the East Coast of the United States from being destroyed by a Luthor-created tidal wave). [163]   Ultimate Marvel [ edit ]  The Ultimate Marvel version of Doctor Octopus is younger, more muscular, and wears sunglasses to disguise scars from the accident that fused him to his metal arms. His arms are made of nanobots, and thus can transform into different tools. He initially claims to have a psychic link with his metal arms, demonstrated by controlling them remotely. [164] He later reveals he can manipulate all metal known as Ferrokinesis. [165]  Dr. Otto Octavius is introduced as a scientist at OsCorp and secretly a corporate spy for Justin Hammer , Norman Osborn\\'s business rival. He is caught in a lab accident involving the drug OZ that also turns Norman into the Green Goblin (infecting his son Harry as well). After this accident, his traditional metal arms are grafted onto his body and he is able to communicate with these mechanical arms via telepathy. He modifies his arms to have the power to morph into different shapes, and then seeks revenge against Hammer, but Spider-Man intervenes. Although Octavius is defeated by Spider-Man, Justin perishes due to a heart attack caused by Octavius attacking him. Afterwards, Octavius is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he, along with Osborn, form the Ultimate Six , consisting of some of Spider-Man\\'s rogues gallery . There are only five villains to begin with, but Osborn planned to bring Spider-Man into the group. The five attack S.H.I.E.L.D. and capture an unmasked Spider-Man. They tie him to a chair, and Osborn humiliates Peter Parker by recounting the accident behind them, and he and Otto\\'s involvements. Osborn then blackmails Peter into joining them, threatening Mary Jane Watson\\'s life. In a battle between the Six and the Ultimates on the White House lawn, Doc Ock is taken down by the Wasp . Octavius is separated from his tentacles and held in a different prison far away from them. Octavius later finds out that his ex-wife is giving the rights to use his likeness in the Spider-Man film. Outraged, he summons his tentacles from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and goes on a rampage. He manages to capture Spider-Man, and he brings him aboard an airplane, ties him to a chair, and unmasks him. From there, he inflicts humiliation and torture on to Peter, mocking him as a teenager, pulling a tooth out, and webbing his mouth. Peter escaped, and defeats Octavius. Back in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Nick Fury melts Doctor Octopus\\' mechanical arms in front of him and instructs the guards to watch the melting mechanism for at least an hour afterwards to make sure the arms would not try to escape. However, in the Ultimate Hobgoblin story arc, it was revealed that a spare set of arms existed within a bunker belonging to Osborn. Plans for these remain to be seen. In the \" Ultimate Clone Saga \", Octavius was revealed to be responsible for all the Spider-Man clones, including an older clone believing itself to be Richard Parker , and a Gwen Stacy clone that can transform into the Carnage creature. His experimentation and research was done for the FBI / CIA (both organizations are said to be behind it in different issues) in order to find a way to create super soldiers so the U.S. Government wouldn\\'t have to be reliant on Fury\\'s monopoly on the Ultimates. [ volume\\xa0&\\xa0issue\\xa0needed ] He smugly reveals he is now outside Fury\\'s jurisdiction and takes pleasure in pointing out to Peter that his work perverts the hero\\'s life. He creates a new set of arms out of metal scraps and battles both Spider-Man and Spider-Woman , killing a clone in the process, before being knocked out. [165]  Octavius makes a brief appearance, confronting Osborn as the latter breaks out of the Triskelion ; he attacks his former boss to prevent his escape, informing him that he betrayed him by giving the OZ formula to the FBI. Octavius is beating Osborn senseless until his other former ally Electro intervenes and shocks Octavius with a bolt of electricity, knocking him out. [166]  During the Ultimate Mystery , Doctor Octopus appears as a member of Roxxon \\'s Brain Trust. [167]  Alongside the rest of the Ultimate Six, Octavius plays a role in the \"Death of Spider-Man\" storyline. Osborn breaks him and the rest out of the Triskelion. After their escape, Osborn informs them that God wishes for them to kill Spider-Man. [168] Octavius wanted to leave the group, because he wanted to live a normal life as a scientist and also said that he took enough pride in helping Spider-Man\\'s existence. The Goblin was outraged by the fact that Octavius tried to share credit for Spider-Man\\'s existence and attacked him. The two of them fought, which ended with the Goblin pummeling Octavius to death.

       " 'Dorling Kindersley': 'British publisher of general reference and illustrated non-fiction books  DK Parent company Penguin Random House Founded 1974 ; 47\\xa0years ago ( 1974 ) London , England , U.K. Founders Christopher Dorling Peter Kindersley Country of origin United Kingdom Headquarters location 80 Strand [1] London , England, U.K. Imprints Alpha, DK Eyewitness Travel Official website www .dk .com  DK , formerly known as Dorling Kindersley , is a British multinational publishing company specialising in illustrated reference books for adults and children in 63 languages.

[2] The first book published under the DK name was a First Aid Manual for the British voluntary medical services. DK Inc. began publishing in the United States in 1991. That same year, Microsoft bought a 26 percent stake in DK. [4] In 1999, it overestimated the market for Star Wars books and was left with millions of unsold copies, resulting in crippling debt. [5] As a direct result, DK was taken over the following year by the Pearson plc media company and made part of Penguin Group , which also owned the Penguin Books label. [6] DK has continued to sell Star Wars books after the takeover. [7] In 2013, Bertelsmann and Pearson completed a merger to form Penguin Random House. [8] Bertelsmann owned 53% and Pearson 47% of the company. Penguin\\'s trade publishing activity continued to include DK under the newly formed Penguin Random House. [9] In July 2017, Pearson agreed to sell a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann, thereby retaining a 25% holding. [10]  [11] In December 2019, Bertelsmann agreed to acquire Pearson\\'s 25% in Penguin Random House, and therefore DK, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann. [12] In 2019, Prima Games was sold to Asteri Holdings. [13]   Publications [ edit ]  See also: List of publications of Dorling Kindersley   DK\\'s London office is at Shell Mex House , 80 Strand, a 1930s Art Deco building.  DK publishes a range of titles internationally for adults and children. Most of the company\\'s books are produced by teams of editors and designers who work with freelance writers and illustrators. Some are endorsed by \"imprimaturs\": such as the British Medical Association , the Royal Horticultural Society and the British Red Cross .  BradyGames [ edit ]  BradyGames was a publishing company in the United States operating as a DK imprint , which specializes in video game  strategy guides , covering multiple video game platforms . It published its first strategy guide in November 1993 as a division of MacMillan Computer Publishing . In 1998, Simon & Schuster (which acquired Macmillan in 1994) divested BradyGames as part of its educational division to Pearson plc . [14] BradyGames has grown to publish roughly 90-100 guides per year. On 1 June 2015, BradyGames merged with Prima Games , and future strategy guides made by the publishing company were published under the Prima Games label, [15] which was sold to Asteri Holdings in 2019.  Young adult [ edit ]  DK commenced publishing books aimed at teens with the release of Heads Up Psychology in 2014.
